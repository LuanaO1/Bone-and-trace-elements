	abstract = {We report a case of clinically significant micronutrient deficiencies following biliary pancreatic diversion (BPD) surgery. Our patient was admitted to hospital six years after BPD surgery following a low impact humeral fracture complicated by postoperative wound infection. On presentation she complained of a widespread rash and loss of night vision. Laboratory testing confirmed hypoalbuminaemia, deficiencies of vitamins A, E and D and of the trace elements copper, zinc and selenium. Bone densitometry confirmed osteoporosis. The skin rash was thought to be due to zinc deficiency and improved with conservative measures and trace element replacement. Her night blindness resolved 48 hours after receiving high dose parenteral vitamin A. Six months later she was readmitted to our intensive care unit with wound dehiscence at her fracture site and clinical features of sepsis and encephalopathy. This case highlights the importance of devising treatment and follow-up guidance prior to surgery and multidisciplinary team involvement including the patient so that long-term metabolic complications are avoided.},

Osteoporotic fractures are a common problem in public health control and intervention, which relate to increasing immobility and mortality, affecting quality of life, and high economic impact due to extended hospital stay (Black and Rosen, 2016; Kawalkar, 2015). Intervention policies are necessary to diagnose and reduce the risk of fractures (Si et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2021). There are various associated factors, such as female gender (Black and Rosen, 2016; Pietschmann et al., 2009), old age (Aspray and Hill, 2019; Giusti and Bianchi, 2014), calcium intake (Cano et al., 2018), vitamin D level (Cano et al., 2018; Weaver et al., 2016), and genetic variations (Conti et al., 2015; He et al., 2015; Kubota et al., 2001). There are various genes involved in osteoclast proliferation, which are associated with bone mass reduction or osteoporotic fractures, including the vitamin D receptor (VDR), estrogen receptor, and collagen type I alpha-I genes (Stewart and Ralston, 2000). Vitamin D and its active metabolites participate in the processes of bone tissue mineralization, maintaining calcium homeostasis, and bone remodeling, which are mediated through the VDR (Ahn et al., 2009). The variations VDR gene polymorphisms have been reported, and VDR genotypes are associated with bone diseases, including multiple sclerosis, osteoporosis, vitamin D-dependent rickets type II (Cantorna and Mahon, 2004; Jiang et al., 2020; Valdivielso and Fernandez, 2006), and essential hypertension (Banjabi et al., 2020).

	doi = {10.19112/2413-6174-2021-22-1-32-43},
	year = {2021},
	abstract = {A brief review of the physiology of conditionally essential trace elements and their status among vegetarians and vegans is presented. To date, the biological role of conditionally essential trace elements has been studied much worse than the role of essential trace elements and, especially, macroelements. Nevertheless, they perform a number of important functions in the human body, and the development of their deficiency may lead to unpleasant consequences. Fluorine plays an important role in calcium-phosphorus metabolism and bone tissue development. In addition, it is necessary to maintain normal oral flora. With its deficiency, the risk of osteoporosis development increases while the resistance of tooth enamel to bacterial damage decreases. Despite the evidence that vegetarians are more likely to develop caries than omnivores, it is premature to conclude that they are poorly supplied with fluoride, primarily because drinking water is still the main source of fluoride. The most studied function of silicon is its involvement in the collagen synthesis. Thus, with silicon defi-ciency, the formation of connective tissue, including the organic matrix of the bones, is disturbed. Despite the fact that silicon is mainly found in plant foods, vegans should be mindful about its status, since they have an increased risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis. There is a lack of data on the physiological significance of bromine. Presumably, it is involved in the activa-tion of certain digestive enzymes, inhibitory processes in the nervous system. Although vegetarians and vegans seem to consume less bromine than omnivores, they are probably at a higher risk of intoxication with this element. This is due to the fact that bromine-containing pesticides are actively used in agriculture and can accumulate in plants. Vegetarians and vegans consume more plant foods. The situation is aggravated by the fact that bromine accumulates more actively against the background of iodine deficiency, which is often observed in these population groups. Boron plays a role in the glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as in the vitamin D, calcium and phosphates exchange, thus participating in the formation of an inorganic matrix of bones. It is unlikely that vegetarians and vegans have an increased risk of developing nutritional deficiency of boron compared to omnivores. However, considering data on a higher risk of vitamin D and calcium deficiency and osteoporosis, monitoring and correction of boron status can affect the prevalence of metabolic disturbances in bone tissue among vegans.},

	abstract = {Osteoporosis( OP) is a systemic bone disease featured with lowbone mass density,bone fragility due to bone microstructural damage and prone to fracture. Trace elements in human and animal bones is necessary for growth and development,and play an important role in bone metabolism and turnover. Bone metabolism is regulated by many factors through systemic or local way,and is effected by minerals and elements acting on bone cells directly or indirectly. For example,fluorine concentrate at the site of newformed bone prmoting mesh structure and increaing bone mass; aluminum broken bone matrix by destroying the function of osteoblasts; magnesium promote bone turnover by stimulating osteoclast function; zinc act on the thyroid to regulate the secretion of calcium,affect bone turnover;,and promote the growth and differentiaion of osteogenesis conductine to bone calcification; copper inhibit osteoblasts and osteoclasts function leading to lowbone turnover; iodine involved in the composition of thyroid hormone leading to lowbone turnover. In addition,there are trace elements playing special role in human metabolism,such as copper, manganese,zinc and other activities involved in the composition and function of some enzymes,they regulate these enzymes to effect bone metabolism; selenium can maintain normal bone metabolism by selenoproteins antioxidative; Manganese is involved in activation of chondroitin sulfate synthetase system,and can stimulate the differentiation of osteoblasts. This paper riviews the research of zinc,selenium,manganese and strontium in osteoporosis,and provides theoreitc evidence for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis using trace elements.},

	year = {2019},
	abstract = {For the past several decades, synchrotron radiation has been extensively used to measure the spatial distribution and chemical affinity of elements found in trace concentrations (<few μg/g) in animal and human tissues. Intense and highly focused (lateral size of several micrometers) X-ray beams combined with small steps of photon energy tuning (2–3 eV) of synchrotron radiation allowed X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques to nondestructively and simultaneously detect trace elements as well as identify their chemical affinity and speciation in situ, respectively. Although limited by measurement time and radiation damage to the tissue, these techniques are commonly used to obtain two-dimensional and three-dimensional maps of several elements at synchrotron facilities around the world. The spatial distribution and chemistry of the trace elements obtained is then correlated to the targeted anatomical structures and to the biological functions (normal or pathological). For example, synchrotron-based in vitro studies of various human tissues showed significant differences between the normal and pathological distributions of metallic trace elements such as iron, zinc, copper, and lead in relation to human diseases ranging from Parkinson’s disease and cancer to osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. Current research effort is aimed at not only measuring the abnormal elemental distributions associated with various diseases, but also indicate or discover possible biological mechanisms that could explain such observations. While a number of studies confirmed and strengthened previous knowledge, others revealed or suggested new possible roles of trace elements or provided a more accurate spatial distribution in relation to the underlying histology. This area of research is at the intersection of several current fundamental and applied scientific inquiries such as metabolomics, medicine, biochemistry, toxicology, food science, health physics, and environmental and public health.},

	abstract = {Iron is an essential component of every living organism. Iron excess and deficiency are equally detrimental for the cell and thus species longevity. They cause very large number of health disorders and organ system dysfunctions, especially development of age related diseases in elderly people. Iron deficiency increases morbidity and mortality because it causes growth arrest and cell death. Age-related accumulation of iron increases the potential for free redox-active iron, which can promote oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage and thus functional alterations of antioxidant enzymes and further increased oxidative damage to DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids in tissues in elderly people. This further increases the risk for cancer, liver diseases, cardiovascular disorders associated with atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, numerous symptoms and neurodegenerative disorders which accompany ageing (Alzheimer’s, early-onset Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, etc.). Experimental animal studies provide new insights in iron manipulation mechanisms (ferritin, frataxin, mitochondrial autophagy) involved in species longevity and suggest further investigation to elucidate possible application for treatment in human degenerative and age-related diseases.},

	abstract = {Osteoporotic femur fractures are the most common fragility fracture and account for approximately one million injuries per year. Local intervention by intra-marrow injection is potentially a good choice for preventing osteoporotic bone loss when the osteoporotic femoral fracture was treated. Previously, it was shown that trace element co-doped calcium phosphate (teCaP) implants could stimulate osteoporotic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell activity in vitro and bone regeneration in femoral bone defects in osteoporotic animal models. They hypothesized that local intra-marrow injection of teCaP particles could improve bone function because the teCaP can sustain release of biologically essential inorganic minerals and improve bone remodeling in osteoporosis. The teCaP and CaP particles were synthesized in simulated body fluid with and without adding silicon, zinc and strontium ions. Female rats (8 months) were ovariectomized (OVX) or sham-operated, and then intervened in the femoral marrow space at 12 months old. Groups include: (1) saline water; (2) CaP particles; and (3) teCaP particles. After 2-3 months of intervention, the sham groups showed higher bone mineral density (MBD) in the femur, and teCaP group increased the BMD in the OVX groups. The compressive strength of the OVX-teCaP group was significantly higher than that in the OVX-CaP group. Significant differences between OVX-teCaP and OVX-CaP groups were found for bone mineral microarchitecture, bone mineral density, and trace mineral content, but not for feces composition. These results confirm the teCaP particles could suppress osteoporotic bone loss by local intramarrow injection. Therefore, this biomaterial could be used as a next-generation combination treatment for osteoporotic trauma and osteoporosis itself. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A total of 70 children with cerebral palsy and 70 healthy controls aged 0–4 years old were enrolled in the present study. The examined children were also divided into two age groups of those younger and older than 2 years old. Hair trace element content was assessed using ICP-MS at NexION 300D (PerkinElmer, USA). The obtained data demonstrate that hair boron was more than 2-fold lower in CP children as compared with the control group. At the same time, hair Na, Se, and V levels were 21%, 12%, and 20% lower when compared with healthy controls, respectively. It is also notable that a 9% and 28% decrease in hair Fe and Li levels respectively were nearly significant. The observed alterations were more profound in a younger group of patients. No significant group difference in hair toxic metal and metalloid levels was observed between the general cohorts of children with and without CP. In regression models, only hair Al and Ca contents were significantly associated with the presence of cerebral palsy, whereas hair Mg, Na, Ni, and Se levels were characterized as significant negative predictors. The observed alteration in trace element metabolism may also provide an additional link between cerebral palsy, psychomotor delay, and certain diseases, including diabetes, epilepsy, and osteoporosis. However, further studies using other substrates (blood, urine) or biomarkers are required.},

	year = {2016},
	abstract = {Background Life style and physical activity play a pivotal role in prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. The mechanism for better bone metabolism and improvement of physical disorders is not clear yet. Trace minerals such as Ca, Mn, Cu, and Zn are essential precursors for most vital biological process, especially those of bone health. Objective The main target of this study was evaluating the effective role of supervised aerobic exercise for 1 hour/day, 3 days/week for 12 weeks in the functions of trace elements in bone health through measuring bone mineral density (BMD), osteoporosis (T-score), bone markers, and trace element concentrations in healthy subjects aged 30–60 years with age average of 41.2±4.9. Methods A total of 100 healthy subjects (47 males, 53 females; age range 30–60 years) were recruited for this study. Based on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan analysis, the participants were classified into three groups: normal (n=30), osteopenic (n=40), and osteoporotic (n=30). Following, 12 weeks of moderate aerobic exercise, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), BMD, T-score, and trace elements such as Ca, Mn, Cu, and Zn were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Results Significant improvement in serum BAP level, T-score, and BMD were observed in all participants following 12 weeks of moderate exercise. Participants with osteopenia and osteoporosis showed significant increase in serum Ca and Mn, along with decrease in serum Cu and Zn levels following 12 weeks of aerobic training. In control group, the improvements in serum trace elements and body mass index were significantly linked with the enhancement in the levels of BAP, BMD hip, and BMD spine. These results supported the preventive effects of moderate exercise in healthy subjects against osteoporosis. In both sexes, the changes in serum trace elements significantly correlated (P<0.05) with the improvement in BAP, BMD hip, BMD spine, and body mass index in all groups. Conclusion The observed changes in the levels of Ca, Mn, Cu, and Zn were shown to be positively correlated with improved bone mass density among control and osteoporosis subjects of both sexes. These results demonstrate that aerobic exercise of moderate intensity might protect bone and cartilage by regulation of body trace elements which are involved in the biosynthesis of bone matrix structures and inhibition of bone resorption process via a proposed anti-free radical mechanism.},

Liver samples, both metacarpi, and carcass data were collected from 21 and 22 moose calves shot in 1994 in Birkenes (southern Norway), and Nærøy (central Norway), respectively. The liver samples were analyzed for copper, manganese, zinc, cobalt, chromium, molybdenum, and selenium. Bone samples were subject to histologic, radiologic, and chemical examinations. Three of the calves from Birkenes and one calf from Nærøy showed histologic and radiologic evidence of generalized osteoporosis consistent with osteoporosis due to starvation. The calves with osteoporosis had the lowest carcass weights and radio-opacities recorded. There was a positive correlation between carcass weight and bone radio-opacity. Density, ash content, phosphorus, and calcium contents and phosphorous/calcium ratio in bone samples, as well as hepatic trace element status, were within the normal range for all calves in both populations. Two of the osteoporotic calves, were reported to have been orphaned. Our results indicate that the high frequency of bone fractures reported in moose in southern Norway is not associated with regional differences in trace element status or bone mineral balance. We propose that the occurrence of osteoporosis in moose calves in Birkenes may have resulted from inadequate nutrition following general overcrowding and high pressure on feed resources in the southernmost part of Norway.},

The spatial patterns were studied using inverse distance weighted interpolation and cluster analysis. The exposed population was estimated based on two datasets: (1) population density in the smallest census unit, the parishes, and (2) geocoded addresses where at least one person is residing. We found significant spatial variation in the exposure for all three elements, related mainly to geochemical processes. This suggests a prospective opportunity for future epidemiological investigation of long-term effects of I, Li, and Sr, either alone or in combinations with other geogenic elements such as Ca, Mg or F.},

	abstract = {Osteoporosis is one of the most common debilitating disease around the world and it is more and more established among young people. There are well known recommendations for nutrition of newborns and children concerning adequate calcium and vitamin D intake in order to maintain proper bone density. Nevertheless, important role in structure and function of a healthy bone tissue is played by an integration between all constituents including elements other than Ca, like trace elements, which control vital processes in bone tissue. It is important from scientific point of view as well as prevention of bone diseases, to monitor the mineralization process considering changes of the concentration of minerals during first stage of bone formation. This work presents studies of trace element (zinc, strontium, and iron) concentration in bones and teeth of Wistar rats at the age of 7, 14, and 28 days. Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) was used to examine mandibles, skulls, femurs, tibiae, and incisors. The quantitative analysis was performed using fundamental parameters method (FP). Zn and Sr concentrations were highest for the youngest individuals and decreased with age of rats, while Fe content was stable in bone matrix for most studied bones. Our results reveal the necessity of monitoring concentration of not only major, but also minor elements, because the trace elements play special role in the first period of bone development.},

Amalgam dental fillings had an effect on the Cu concentration in the cartilage with the adjacent compact bone, and on Hg concentration in the spongy bone. The highest concentrations of Cu and Hg were found in people with multiple amalgam fillings. Smoking appeared to influence Pb concentration in the cartilage with the adjacent compact bone, and Cd concentration in the spongy bone. Increased Pb was detected in smokers, and increased Cd in non-smokers. Diets rich in fish and seafood correlated with Cd concentration in the cartilage with adjacent compact bone.

Materials and methods: A case control study (50 diabetic patients and 50 non-diabetic participants) was conducted among elderly, aged ≥ 60 years, recruited from geriatric outpatient clinic in Ain Shams University Hospital. Patients were subjected to comprehensive geriatric evaluation followed by assessment of BMD by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry in femoral neck and lumbar spine, and T score recording. Zn, Cu, Mg and hs-CRP blood levels were measured for all participants. Results: Diabetic patients had significantly lower values of Zn and Mg and higher values of Cu and hs-CRP than non diabetics (P ˂ 0.001 for all parameters). In the studied group, type 2 DM is not alone a risk factor for osteoporosis and low Mg level is a significant predictor of the lumbar spine T score (P= 0.023) rather than the femoral neck one (P= 0.51), after adjusting for other covariates. Conclusion: Diabetics have lower Zn and Mg and higher Cu and hs-CRP levels than non diabetics. In elderly low Mg is a significant predictor of low BMD only in the lumbar spine, and standalone type 2 DM can’t be considered as a risk factor for osteoporosis.},

	year = {2020},
	abstract = {The prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in children is an urgent problem of pediatrics and pediatric endocrinology. This is due to the need for preventive measures for the formation of adequate bone mass and bone strength, the duration of rehabilitation during the development of the disease and the occurrence of fractures, as well as the requirements for optimizing the treatment of this pathology in childhood.Bone tissue is a dynamic and constantly updated system. The main regulators of osteogenesis include trace elements (calcium, phosphorus, zinc, fluorine, etc.), vitamin D, hormones (parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, growth hormone, corticosteroids, etc.), growth factors (IRF-1, IRF-2, ERF, FRF, etc.), local bone-resorbing factors (IL-1, IL-6, TNF, PGE, etc.) and mechanical stress. Remodeling processes continue throughout life, but are most intense until 18 years of age.The most important risk factors for developing osteoporosis are a history of prematurity and / or IUGR, rickets, low intake of protein, calcium and vitamin D, weight deficiency, periods of active growth, low physical activity, endocrine diseases (diabetes mellitus, growth hormone deficiency, hypogonadism, etc.), somatic pathology (chronic diseases of the kidneys, liver, malabsorption), taking certain medications (GCS, anticonvulsants, cytostatics, etc.). Clinical manifestations of osteoporosis in children include signs of tissue calcium deficiency (trophic changes in the nails, hair and tooth enamel, paresthesia, pain in the calf muscles) and a decrease in bone mineralization (impaired posture, slowed growth, pain in the spine and large joints, pathological low-energy fractures) Measures to prevent osteoporosis in childhood include regular physical activity, a balanced diet, adequate insolation, and the identification and treatment of somatic pathology. Additional pharmacological correction is carried out in risk groups – the recommended course use of preparations containing vitamin D, calcium and other osteotropic minerals.The treatment of osteoporosis in children and adolescents is actively debated. A mandatory component of therapy are calcium salts in combination with vitamin D. The possibility of using bisphosphonates is being examined, the effect of monoclonal antibodies (denosumab), somatropin and anabolic steroids on bone metabolism is being studied. In addition, non-pharmacological methods are prescribed - orthopedic correction for fractures, exercise therapy, gymnastics, therapeutic swimming and massage.},

	abstract = {Iron is one of the important trace elements in life activities. Abnormal iron metabolism increases the incidence of many skeletal diseases, especially for osteoporosis. Iron metabolism plays a key role in the bone homeostasis. Disturbance of iron metabolism not only promotes osteoclast differentiation and apoptosis of osteoblasts but also inhibits proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts, which eventually destroys the balance of bone remodeling. The strength and density of bone can be weakened by the disordered iron metabolism, which increases the incidence of osteoporosis. Clinically, compounds or drugs that regulate iron metabolism are used for the treatment of osteoporosis. The goal of this review summarizes the new progress on the effect of iron overload or deficiency on osteoporosis and the mechanism of disordered iron metabolism on osteoporosis. Explaining the relationship of iron metabolism with osteoporosis may provide ideas for clinical treatment and development of new drugs.},

	year = {2019},
	abstract = {Bone healing involves compositional changes and understanding these is potentially important for prevention and treatment of bone diseases like osteoporosis. The health and proper function of bone tissues depends crucially major elements like calcium and phosphorus, but also on trace elements like iron, zinc, and strontium. This work employs energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (μ-EDXRF) for trace element analysis, particularly of iron, and Raman spectroscopy for analysis of collagen, during healing of subcritical calvarial defects. In vivo defects were created on the calvaria of Sprague-Dawley rats (n=16) using a 1.4 mm burr drill. Subjects were sacrificed and additional control defects were similarly created after 7 (n=8) and 14 days (n=8) of healing. The two spectroscopy methods analyzed the bone surface at both time points and defect types without mechanical perturbation. Compared to control defects, calcium was found significantly decreased while zinc and iron increased in in vivo defects. Iron increased 6.7fold after 7 days, and this increased reduced approximately 50% after 14 days. Raman showed decreased collagen alignment after 7 days, which became insignificant after 14 days. We deduce that new collagen formation during healing, as revealed by Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron and optical microscopy and surface profiling, resulted in trace element changes. Our results show the need for studying the concentrations of major and trace elements, with iron in particular playing a crucial role in healing.},

	doi = {10.3389/fchem.2022.839062},
	year = {2022},
	abstract = {Deteriorated bone quality in osteoporosis challenges the success of implants, which are in urgent need for better early osseointegration as well as antibacterial property for long-term stability. As osteoporotic bone formation tangles with angiogenic clues, the relationship between osteogenesis and angiogenesis has been a novel therapy target for osteoporosis. However, few designs of implant coatings take the compromised osteoporotic angiogenic microenvironment into consideration. Here, we investigated the angiogenic effects of bioactive strontium ions of different doses in HUVECs only and in a co-culture system with BMSCs. A proper dose of strontium ions (0.2–1 mM) could enhance the secretion of VEGFA and Ang-1 in HUVECs as well as in the co-culture system with BMSCs, exhibiting potential to create an angiogenic microenvironment in the early stage that would be beneficial to osteogenesis. Based on the dose screening, we fabricated a bioactive titanium surface doped with zinc and different doses of strontium by plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO), for the establishment of a microenvironment favoring osseointegration for osteoporosis. The dual bioactive elements augmented titanium surfaces induced robust osteogenic differentiation, and enhanced antimicrobial properties. Augmented titanium implant surfaces exhibited improved bone formation and bone–implant contact under comprehensive assessment of an in vivo bone–implant interface. In conclusion, zinc- and strontium-augmented titanium surface benefits the osseointegration in osteoporosis via promoting osteogenic differentiation, exerting antibacterial efficacy, and stimulating early angiogenesis.},

	abstract = {It has always been a clinical challenge to use the proper implants or biomaterials to restore function to traumatized bone defects in patients with osteoporosis. In this study, we prepared the alginate-chitosan/trace elements-multidoped octacalcium phosphate-bioglass (AT-CS/teOCP-BG) hydrogel composite as an injectable biomaterial and evaluated its physicochemical properties and biological performance. Trace amount of silicon, strontium, and zinc was first doped into the structure of OCP porous microspheres via a wet chemical reaction. The AT-CS complex was mechanically mixed with teOCP and then neutralized by the ionic products of bioglass 58S particles dissolution. Formulations of this novel composite presented in wet state have teOCP-BG contents ranging from 7.8 to 25.4% and AT-CS content of below 3.2%. The composite retained gel in culture medium at 37°C, and the ratio of storage modulus and loss modulus (G'/G″) exhibited a marked increase with decreasing the amount of BG, signifying a pH-dependent enhancement of rheological properties and gel stability. After injection into rat femoral bone marrow cavity with minimal tissue invasion, new bone ingrowth was observed from radiologic images in the ovariectomized (OVXed) rats, which was significantly greater than that found in sham-operated animals within 8 weeks postoperatively. The fast bone regeneration phenomenon was observed in the OVXed rats by radiographic and microcomputerized tomography examination and histological analysis. These findings suggest that the AT-CS/teOCP-BG system might be used as an injectable biomaterial for minimally invasive treatment of osteoporosis-related (micro-)trauma.},

Of all the elements whose concentrations we analyzed in our studies, only magnesium was found to correlate with smoking, place of residence, and age. Our findings regarding the quantities of selected elements in the infrapatellar fat pad may be used for the interpretation and analysis of biological, morphological, and mechanical changes in the human body.},

	abstract = {Several trace elements, particularly, manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn), are essential in bone metabolism as cofactors for specific enzymes. It has been reported that there exists the relationship between osteoporosis and trace element-deficiency and the efficacy of Ca, Mn and Zn supplementation on spinal bone mineral density in postmenopausal women. Traditional Chinese medicines (TCM), such as Herba epimedii, were proved to be effective for prevention of osteoprosis in vivo; however, the efficacy of the main constituents and/or crude extract was not ideal in vitro, which suggested that they may work in another way. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether the combination of icariin and total flavonoids (TF) from Herba epimedii with mineral elements, which were abundant in Herba epimedii, would have a more beneficial effect on the viability and differentiation of primary osteoblasts than either agent alone, and to analyze the dada for a possible synergistic, additive or antagonistic effect. The combinations of 10 μmol/L Zn, Ca and Mn with icariin and total flavonoids greatly improved the cell viability and meanwhile dramatically enhanced the alkaline phosphatase activity as compared to each agent alone. On the other hand, an increased cell growth inhibition was also observed by combining 0.1 μmol/L, 1 μmol/L Zn with 10 μmol/L icariin, and 10 μmol/L Mn with 0.06 μg/mL total flavonoids. Meanwhile a decreased alkaline phosphatase activity was also found in several icariin-Zn/Mn and total flavonoids-Zn/Ca/Mn combinations. These results suggested that mineral elements (Zn, Ca, Mn) greatly enhanced the efficacy of icariin and total flavonoids from Herba epimedii on the viability and differentiation of primary osteoblasts by certain combinations.},

This review focuses on newer methods of diagnosing osteoporosis and assessing fracture risk, as well as on novel management strategies for prevention and treatment. Fracture-risk prediction has been significantly enhanced by the development of methods such as the trabecular bone score, which helps assess bone microarchitecture and adds value to standard bone densitometry, and the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) algorithm techniques. The treatment of osteoporosis, which has the goals of fracture prevention and risk reduction, is moving beyond traditional monotherapies with antiresorptives and anabolic agents into new combination regimens.},

	year = {2006},
	abstract = {Smoking has been accepted as a risk factor for many chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, cancer, ulcers and osteoporosis. Tobacco smoke contains many oxidants and free radicals that can cause damage to lipids, proteins, DNA, carbohydrates and other biomolecules. In vivo, antioxidant nutrients which include vitamin C, selenium (Se), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) play a crucial role in defending against oxidant damage. The present study was designed to investigate the influence of cigarette smoking on serum vitamin C, Se, Zn, Cu and lipid profile. One hundred and forty healthy men (70 Smokers and 70 non-smokers) from Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, volunteered to participate in this study. Blood pressure and anthropometric measurements were done by well-trained staff. Two overnight fasting blood samples were collected from all volunteers. Serum concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol) and triglyceride (TG) determinations were performed by a Cobas Integra analyzer. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol) was calculated using the Friedewalde formula. Serum vitamin C analysis was determined by a high-performance liquid chromatograph and serum concentrations of trace elements were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The statistical method of t-test was used to identify differences between the cigarette smoker and non-smoker groups. Mean body weight and body mass index (BMI) were similar for both the smoker and non-smoker groups. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure values were significantly (P<0.05) higher for smokers than those of non-smokers. The serum vitamin C, zinc and selenium levels of smokers were significantly (P<0.05) lower than those of non-smokers. Smokers had significantly (P<0.05) higher serum copper concentration than non-smokers. The serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol) and triglyceride levels of smokers were significantly (P<0.05) higher than those of non-smokers. On the contrary, the serum HDL-cholesterol of smokers was significantly (P<0.05) lower than that of non-smokers. These findings suggest that cigarette smoking may cause an imbalance between antioxidant nutrient status and free-radical load incurred by smoking which may initiate the deterioration process associated with cardiovascular disease; thereby, increasing the risk of atherosclerosis and other diseases.},

	abstract = {Zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and iron (Fe) are essential trace elements for the growth, development, and maintenance of healthy bones. However, there are conflicting reports as to the relationship between serum level of Zn, Cu, or Fe and osteoporosis (OP). The purpose of the present study is to clarify the relationship between serum Zn, Cu, or Fe and OP using a meta-analysis approach. We searched all articles indexed in PubMed published up to May 2014 concerning the association between serum level of Zn, Cu, or Fe and OP. Eight eligible articles involving 2,188 subjects were identified. Overall, pooled analysis indicated that patients with OP had a lower serum level of Zn, Cu, or Fe than the healthy controls (Zn standardized mean difference (SMD) = −1.396, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = [−2.129, −0.663]; Cu SMD = −0.386, 95 % CI = [−0.538, −0.234]; Fe SMD = −0.22, 95 % CI = [−0.30, −0.13]). Further subgroup analysis found that geographical location and gender had an influence on the serum level of Zn in OP and healthy controls, but not on the serum level of Cu or Fe. No evidence of publication bias was observed. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that low serum levels of Zn, Cu, and Fe seem to be important risk factors for OP and well-designed studies with adequate control for confounding factors are required in future investigations.},

Among environmental factors, diet may play a key role, affording a target for low-cost intervention. Calcium and vitamin D are well known to affect bone metabolism. Other nutrients may influence bone mass changes; for instance, a number of trace elements and vitamins other than vitamin D are essential to many of the steps of bone metabolism. A wide variety of foods provide these nutrients, and in industrialized countries deficiencies are more often due to idiosyncratic eating habits than to cultural influences. Both culture and vogue influence the amount of carbohydrate, fat, and protein in the typical diet. In children, the current trend is to reduce protein and to increase carbohydrate and fat. Data from epidemiological and animal studies suggest that this may adversely affect bone mass and the fracture risk.},

	abstract = {Osteoporosis constitutes a growing problem first of all because of the increase in the elderly population (1). In addition, several studies have demonstrated significant increases in age-corrected incidence of osteoporotic fractures during the last decades which makes declining quality of bone an important factor (2). The classical osteoporotic fractures are located at the distal forearm, the spine and the hip, sites that are all dominated by trabecular bone (3). Women are primarily affected but a rising number of men suffer from osteoporotic fractures. Many factors such as sex-hormones, exercise, vitamin D and calcium intake are known to affect the bone turnover and the risk of developing osteoporosis. Specially interesting are marked unexplained differences in the prevalence of osteoporosis in different parts of the world (4) and even within the same geographical areas with lower incidence of osteoporosis in the rural districts compared to the cities (5). A number of trace elements have influence on bone. Some elements are toxic others beneficial and some essential for a normal bone metabolism. Intoxications with aluminum in patients with chronic renal diseases (6), treatment with fluoride in osteoporosis (7), and the Itai-Itai disease caused by cadmium in Japan (8) are important examples. Furthermore, many enzymes need trace elements as cofactors for optimal function. Important enzymes for bone such as alkaline phosphatase and lysyl oxidase are thus dependent on zinc and copper, respectively (9,10).},

Group A as control group was operated without extirpating ovary and only making an incision. All of the rest rats were ovariectomized. The survived ovariectomized rats were marked 3 months later and randomly divided into two groups: group B as model group and group C as treatment group. The rats were sacrificed after another 3 months. The right tibiae of rats were harvested after bone densities of metaphyses of bilateral tibiae were measured. The contents of trace elements in bones of the rats were then detected using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Results ( 1) There were significant differences in bone densities or bone mine contents of metaphyses of bilateral tibiae among each group of rats. The above value in group B was the lowest among all other groups. (2) The values of Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, V, Sr in bones of rats were lower in group B than those in group A ( P 0.01) , and so were Mo, B, Co, Cr, F, Cd, Mg, Ca and P ( P 0.05 ) . There were no significant differences in the content changes of Ni, Ba, B and Pb between two groups. ( 3 ) Comparing to the group A, the content of Ca was lower in the group C(P 0.05) , on the contrary, the content of F increased ( P 0.05) . Comparing to the group B, element contents of the tibiae in rats including Cu, Mn, V, Cr, Fe, Cd, Sr, Zn and Co increased in the group C(P 0.01) . So did B,Cr,Mo,F,Mg,Ca and P (P 0.05) . There were no significant differences in the content changes of Pb, Ba, and Ni between two groups. (4) As to the content changes of Ni, Pb, and Ba in bones, there were no significant differences in each group. Conclusion The content changes of most trace elements in bone are closely associated with estrogen levels. Estrogen improves these trace elements deposition in bone by means of influencing on metabolism of bone cell, thereby the change of bone density.},

	year = {2014},
	abstract = {Purpose This study examined the role of trace elements in osteoporosis by comparing the trace-element concentrations in bone and the radiographic bone density and bone mineral density (BMD) of patients with osteoporotic femur fractures and osteoarthritis. Patients and methods The study enrolled 30 patients operated on for proximal femoral fractures after falls, and another 30 patients undergoing hip arthroplasty at the same center for hip osteoarthritis. Bone samples were obtained during the surgical procedures. The density of the bone samples was assessed using computed tomography and the Hounsfield scale. The levels of Ca(II), Mg(II), and other trace elements in the bone samples were determined using flame atomic absorption spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. In addition, BMD, Z-scores, and T-scores were measured in the unaffected hips of all patients using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results Magnesium (1,908±507 versus 2,540±435, P<0.05), calcium (10.4±3.5 versus 13.9±3.7, P<0.05), and zinc (2,342±1,252 versus 3,145±1,604, P<0.05) μg g−1, levels were significantly lower in the bone samples in the fracture group. The groups did not differ in the other biochemical parameters. All dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry findings were significantly worse in the fracture group than in the osteoarthritis group. However, the groups did not differ in femoral neck density assessed radiologically using the Hounsfield scale. The following parameters were negatively correlated with age: magnesium, r=−0.436, P<0.001; calcium, r=−0.331, P=0.01; T-score, r=−0.381, P=0.003; Z-score, r=−0.267, P=0.043; and BMD, r=−0.365, P=0.004. Conclusion Ca(II), Mg(II), and Zn(II) appear to play important roles in bone breakdown/synthesis. Further studies of the roles of trace elements in the etiology and treatment of osteoporosis are warranted. We found decreased bone levels of Ca, Mg, and Zn in patients with osteoporotic fractures compared to subjects with osteoarthritis.},

	year = {2014},
	abstract = {Background: Trace elements and lipids have an important role in the development of osteoporosis that is a major health problem of postmenopausal women. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to compare the serum levels of zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and lipid profile between the postmenopausal women suffering from osteoporosis and the healthy controls. Furthermore, we aimed to determine whether there is an association between the parameters mentioned above and the bone mineral density (BMD). Patients and Methods: The study was conducted on 116 postmenopausal women; 58 osteoporosis (age 60.6 ± 3.9 years) and 58 control group (age 55.4 ± 1.7 years). The serum levels of Zn and Cu were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry and BMD was analyzed by DEXA scan. Results: The serum levels of Zn and Cu were similar in the both groups (P > 0.05). Serum levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol (TC) in osteoporosis group was statistically significant when compared to the controls (P 0.05). However, we found a negative significant correlation between BMD with LDL (r = -0.31, P = 0.001) and total cholesterol levels (r = -0.26, P = 0.006). Conclusions: This study suggested that dyslipidemia might be an independent risk factor of osteoporosis in Iranian postmenopausal women. Moreover, the trace elements did not directly and correlatively influence BMD.},

	abstract = {Static magnetic fields (SMFs) can enhance the ability of bone formation by osteoblast and is a potential physical therapy to bone disorders and the maintenance of bone health. But, the mechanism is not clear yet. Certain mineral elements including macro and trace elements are essential for normal bone metabolism. Deficiency of these elements can cause severe bone disorders including osteoporosis. However, there are few reports regarding the role of mineral elements in the regulation of bone formation under SMFs. In this study, hypomagnetic field (HyMF) of 500 nT, moderate SMF (MMF) of 0.2 T, and high SMF (HiMF) of 16 T were used to investigate the effects of SMFs on mineral element (calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, and zinc) alteration of MC3T3-E1 cells during osteoblast mineralization. The results showed that osteoblasts in differentiation accumulated more mineral elements than non-differentiated cell cultures. Furthermore, HyMF reduced osteoblast differentiation but did not affect mineral elements levels compared with control of geomagnetic field. MMF decreased osteoblast differentiation with elevated iron content. HiMF enhanced osteoblast differentiation and increased all the mineral contents except copper. It is suggested that the altered potential of osteoblast differentiation under SMFs may partially due to the involvement of different mineral elements.},

	abstract = {Vegetables with edible parts like flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, fibers, roots, and seeds are rich sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements with various medical functions. Many diseases such as osteoporosis, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, heart diseases, and stroke are caused by poor, healthy lifestyle or nutrition. Therefore, generation of new biological functions from vegetables will increase the interests of scientific research and applications. Okra is an edible vegetable which contains vitamins, fiber, carbohydrates, protein, and minerals. The bioactive compounds of okra possess various biological activities such as anti-inflammation, antibacterial, anticancer, and antifungal. Polysaccharides from vegetables or medicinal plants are important large molecules with various biological applications. In this review, we will focus on the biological properties and nanoparticle uses of polysaccharides isolated from okra and the extraction methods of polysaccharides. This review will enhance the scientific research findings of okra polysaccharides and recommend future prospective of polysaccharides for biological uses.},

	abstract = {The effects of trace elements of gallium (Ga), germanium (Ge), and strontium (Sr) on ovariectomized (OVX) osteopenic rats were studied in this paper. The urine calcium content, serum calcium, and phosphorus contents, bone mineral content, mineral dissolution, and mechanical strength of the osteopenic rats were analyzed respectively. After the rats were fed with Ga, Ge, and Sr diet for 8 weeks, respectively, the urine calcium content decreased (P < 0.01). Plasma calcium and phosphate concentrations decreased in the order of OVX group > Ge group > Sr group > Ga group > Sham group. Mineral content increased in the order of OVX group < Ge group < Sr group < Ga group < Sham group. A dramatic decrease in calcium solubility was found both in the gallium and strontium treated animals (P < 0.05). However, the same result did not occur in germanium treated groups. The data provide an important proof of concept that gallium and strontium might be a new potential therapy for the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis in humans.},

	doi = {10.1515/JPEM.2009.22.7.579},
	year = {2009},
	abstract = {Nutrition and food availability can influence the timing of puberty and the maintenance of adult reproductive functions'. Nutrition is also known to affect both linear growth and the timing of pubertal onset. In vivo studies of specific deficiencies, such as lower intake of energy, proteins, zinc, iron, copper, iodine and vitamin A, have demonstrated a close linkage between the growth hormone (GH) axis and vitamin A' and the gonadotropin axis and vitamin A". The full scale effects of nutrients on different systems and hormonal regulation is not yet known. Despite this knowledge, screening of normal children and adolescents, even in prosperous countries, detects subnormal intake of iron, calcium, vitamin A, vitamin D, and more. While pediatric endocrinologists do their best to identify hormonal deficiencies, a similar effort is not invested into the detection of subnormal nutritional intake. Some of the recommended doses of nutritional supplements are traditional, without solid evidence-based proof. The calcium-vitamin D axis has been known for years for its importance in noncalcemic actions, as summarized by Nagpal et α/.. Vitamin D has an important role in immunomodulation mediated by binding to nuclear vitamin D receptors (VDR) which are present in most immune cell types, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and T and B cells. Activation of VDR has potent anti-proliferative and immunomodulatory functions including both immune-enhancing and immunosuppressive effects. Vitamin D has been shown to increase the activity of NK cells, and enhance the phagocytic activity of macrophages. Vitamin D deficiency tends to increase the risk of infections. These immunoregulatory properties may have therapeutic clinical applications in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, dermatological conditions, osteoporosis, cancers, central nervous systems diseases and autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and type 1 diabetes mellitus. From the endocrine point of view, vitamin D deficiency is associated with elevated VLDL triglycerides and impaired insulin metabolism. Studies in non-obese diabetic mice showed that pharmacological doses of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin Da could delay the onset of diabetes mellitus. A study conducted in northern Finland looking into the incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus among a pediatric cohort showed a statistical difference between those with inadequate vitamin D during infancy and childhood and those who received vitamin D supplementation, favoring adequate vitamin D intake as a preventive measure to prevent diabetes mellitus. Well planned control trials and studies to determine adequate doses are needed to study this important issue. Meanwhile, subnormal intake of trace elements and nutrients should be corrected, and subnormal blood levels of nutrients including vitamins should be brought to a normal level.},

	year = {2022},
	abstract = {Osteoporosis has been recognized as a significant cause of disability in the elderly leading to heavy socioeconomic burden. Current measurements such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and bone mineral density (BMD) have limitations. In contrast, trabecular bone score (TBS) is an emerging tool for bone quality assessment. The objective of our study was to investigate the relationship between TBS and trace elements (cadmium and lead). We analyzed all subjects from the 2005-2006 and 2007-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset and included a total of 8,244 participants in our study; 49.4% of the enrolled subjects were male. We used blood cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) concentrations to define environmental exposure. The main variables were TBS and BMD. Other significant demographic features were included as covariates and later adjusted using linear regression models to determine the association between TBS and four quartiles based on the blood trace element concentrations with or without sex differences. The fully adjusted regression model revealed a negative relationship between TBS and blood cadmium (B-Cd) significant for both males and females (both p < 0.05). The β-coefficient for males was -0.009 (95% confidence intervals (CI): (-0.015 to -0.004)) and -0.019 for female (95% CI: (-0.024 to -0.013)). We also found a dose-dependent relationship between TBS and B-Cd for both sexes (both trend's p < 0.05). Our study concluded that TBS could measure Cd-related bone quality deterioration for both males and females.},

	doi = {10.1155/2018/6762146},
	year = {2018},
	abstract = {Glucocorticoids intake is the most common cause of secondary osteoporosis. Clinical studies have shown that 50% patients develop glucocorticoids-induced osteoporosis (GCIOP) after taking glucocorticoids for more than 6 months. Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HYA) is one main active ingredient in Carthamus tinctorius L. Previous studies have shown that HYA promoted bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into osteoblasts which promoted bone formation. Therefore, we speculated that HYA has a therapeutic effect on GCIOP. However, there is no in vivo evidence about the anti-GCIOP effect of HYA. In this paper, the effect of HYA (0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 μM) on bone formation in normal zebrafish was investigated firstly. Secondly, the reversal effect of HYA on GCIOP was also evaluated by zebrafish model. It is demonstrated that HYA not only promoted bone formation in normal zebrafish (compared to Control group), but also reversed glucocorticoid induced bone loss (compared to Prednisolone group) according to the intervention of HYA in upregulating the area of mineralized bones (p < 0.01), increasing cumulative optical density (p < 0.01), promoting bone formation related gene expression (AKP, Type I, Runx2, OPG, and OCN, p < 0.01), inhibiting bone resorption related gene expression (TRACP, p < 0.01), and elevating whole-body trace mineral elements (Ca, P, K, Mg, Zn, and Fe) levels (p < 0.01). In conclusion, HYA had the potential to prevent and heal GCIOP by promoting bone mineralization, osteoblasts viability, and bone collagen expression and inhibiting bone resorption.},

	abstract = {It has been shown that the trace elements and lipids play role in the growth, development and maintenance of bones. We aimed to investigate serum selenium (Se), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and lipid (total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein–cholesterol) levels in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, osteopenia and in healthy controls, and to determine the relationship between Se, Zn, Cu and lipid parameters and bone mineral density (BMD). The study included 107 postmenopausal women; 35 healthy (group 1), 37 osteopenic (group 2) and 35 osteoporotic (group 3). The women in all three groups were carefully matched for body mass index (BMI). Serum concentrations of Se, Zn and Cu were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Plasma Se, Cu, Zn and lipid levels were similar in all groups (p > 0.05). When we combined the women in each of the three groups, and considered them as one group (n = 107) we found a positive correlation between BMI and lumbar vertebra BMD, femur neck BMD, femur total BMD; a positive correlation between TG and femur neck BMD, femur total BMD; a positive correlation between Zn and lumbar vertebra BMD (total T score) (p < 0.05). There was no correlation between Se, Cu, Zn, P and lipid parameters (p > 0.05). Although BMI has a positive effect on BMD, trace elements and lipids, except Zn and TG, did not directly and correlatively influence BMD. Further studies are needed to clarify the role and relationship of trace elements and lipid parameters in postmenopausal osteoporosis.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the difference in the levels of the bone turnover markers, oestrogen, macrominerals and trace elements in premenopausal \& postmenopausal women, in order to assess whether one or more of these markers can be used as indicators for early detection of osteoporosis which can develop in later life. 350 women between 30–65 years were classified into normal, osteopenic and osteoporotic group based on bone mineral density (BMD) and their serum samples were analysed for oestrogen, osteocalcin, telopeptide-c, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, copper, iron and zinc levels. Both in premenopausal and postmenopausal groups the oestrogen, telopeptide-c, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and copper levels correlated well with the status of BMD and served as an early warning against development of future osteoporosis. While levels of iron and zinc showed significant alteration only with severe decline in BMD and were not suitable for early warning of future osteoporosis. It is important to monitor not just postmenopausal but even older premenopausal women for bone mineral density. However, instead of measuring bone mineral density alone, oestrogen, telopeptide-c and mineralscalcium, phosphorus, magnesium and copper should also be estimated which can provide us with an early warning of the possibility of future development of osteoporosis.},

Trace elements may interfere with growth, development and maintenance of bones. Therefore, we investigated whether plasma trace element levels are associated with bone mineral density in elderly males in Beijing. After epidemiologically investigating 91 elderly males with age ranging from 50 years to 80 years, we obtained a total of 30 healthy (group 1), 31 osteopoenic (group 2) and 30 osteoporotic (group 3) subjects. Blood was collected, and serum concentrations of trace elements were detected. Elderly males in the three groups were carefully matched in terms of body mass index. Iron, manganese, zinc, copper, selenium, cadmium and lead were analysed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by QDR-2000 dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Correlation between BMD and serum element contents was analysed using SPSS16.0. The plasma levels of manganese, zinc, copper, selenium and lead were similar in all of the groups (P>0.05). Cadmium was significantly and negatively correlated with BMD of the lumbar vertebrae (P<0.05). Moreover, cadmium and iron contents significantly differed in osteoporotic and healthy groups. These elements may directly and correlatively affect BMD in elderly males. Many trace elements may directly and correlatively influence BMD. Future studies should be conducted to evaluate serum and bone levels of these trace elements to determine the relationship of these trace elements with osteoporosis.},

Recently, several preclinical and clinical studies have investigated the effects of selenium on bone health, although the results are controversial. Selenium, an important trace element, is required for selenoprotein synthesis and acts crucially for proper growth and skeletal development. However, the intake of an optimum amount of selenium is critical, as both selenium deficiency and toxicity are hazardous for health. In this review, we have systematically analyzed the existing literature in this field to determine whether dietary or serum selenium concentrations are associated with bone health. In addition, the mode of administration of selenium as a supplement for treating bone disease is important. We have also highlighted the importance of using green-synthesized selenium nanoparticles as therapeutics for bone disease. Novel nanobiotechnology will be a bridgehead for clinical applications of trace elements and natural products.},

In addition, minerals and trace elements affect bone formation and resorption through direct or indirect effects on bone cells or bone mineral. Some trace elements closely chemically related to calcium, such as strontium (Sr), have pharmacological effects on bone when present at levels higher than those required for normal cell physiology. Indeed, strontium was found to exert several effects on bone cells. In addition to its antiresorptive activity, strontium was found to have anabolic activity in bone, and this may have significant beneficial effects on bone balance in normal and osteopenic animals. Accordingly, strontium has been thought to have potential interest in the treatment of osteoporosis. This review summarizes the mechanisms of action of strontium on bone cells, the evidence for its beneficial effects on bone mass in vivo, and its potential therapeutic effects in osteopenic disorders.},

	doi = {10.1177/0954411914563363},
	year = {2014},
	abstract = {Osteoporosis is a progressive bone disease characterized by deterioration in the quantity and quality of bone, leading to inferior mechanical properties and an increased risk of fracture. Current assessment of osteoporosis is typically based on bone densitometry tools such as Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT) and Dual Energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). These assessment modalities mainly rely on estimating the bone mineral density (BMD). Hence present densitometry tools describe only the deterioration of the quantity of bone associated with the disease and not the affected morphology or microstructural changes, resulting in potential incomplete assessment, many undetected patients, and unexplained fractures. In this study, an in-silico parametric model of vertebral trabecular bone incorporating both material and microstructural parameters was developed towards the accurate assessment of osteoporosis and the consequent risk of bone fracture. The model confirms that the mechanical properties such as strength and stiffness of vertebral trabecular tissue are highly influenced by material properties as well as morphology characteristics such as connectivity, which reflects the quality of connected inter-trabecular parts. The FE cellular solid model presented here provides a holistic approach that incorporates both material and microstructural elements associated with the degenerative process, and hence has the potential to provide clinical practitioners and researchers with more accurate assessment method for the degenerative changes leading to inferior mechanical properties and increased fracture risk associated with age and/or disease such as Osteoporosis.},

	abstract = {Trace rare earth elements such as lanthanum (La) regulated effectively bone tissue performances; however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In order to accelerate bone defects especially in patients with osteoporosis or other metabolic diseases, we firstly constructed lanthanum-doped mesoporous calcium silicate/chitosan (La-MCS/CTS) scaffolds by freeze-drying technology. During the freeze-drying procedure, three-dimensional macropores were produced within the La-MCS/CTS scaffolds by using ice crystals as templates, and the La-MCS nanoparticles were distributed on the macropore walls. The hierarchically porous structures and biocompatible components contributed to the adhesion, spreading and proliferation of rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs), and accelerated the in-growth of new bone tissues. Particularly, the La3+ ions in the bone scaffolds remarkably induced the osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs via the activation of the TGF signal pathway. A critical-sized calvarial-defect rat model further revealed that the La-MCS/CTS scaffolds significantly promoted new bone regeneration as compared with pure MCS/CTS scaffolds. In conclusion, the La-MCS/CTS scaffold showed the prominent ability in osteogenesis and bone regeneration, which showed its application potential for bone defect therapy.},

	abstract = {Certain trace elements play a very important role in bone health. Silicon is one such essential trace element required for bone regeneration, bone mineral density, and overall bone biology. Deficiency of silicon is associated with bone resorption rate, decreased osteoblastogenesis, increased osteoclastogenesis, reduced collagen, and glycosaminoglycan formation, suggesting a definite role of silicon in osteoporosis. Choline-stabilized orthosilicic acid (ch-OSA®) is a stable and bioavailable form of silicon. Due to its stable nature, it cannot be converted into nonabsorbable silica (polymerized) gel form. ch-OSA® is known to stimulate the enzymatic pathway of endogenous collagen synthesis. Silicon supplementation stimulates osteoblasts, osteoblastic differentiation, osteopontin, osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase, and bone matrix mineralization. It inhibits bone resorption by reducing the surface area of osteoclasts. ch-OSA® has shown synergistic effects with calcium and Vitamin D, indicating its potential role in the management of osteoporosis. The aim of this review is to outline the importance of ch-OSA® on bone health.},

	abstract = {Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic heavy metal that represents an occupational hazard and environmental pollutant toxic heavy metal, which can cause osteoporosis following accumulation in the body. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Cd on bone tissue osteoclast differentiation in vivo. Female BALB/c mice were randomly divided into three groups and given drinking water with various concentrations of Cd (0, 5, and 25 mg/L) for 16 weeks, after which the mice were sacrificed after collecting urine and blood. The level of Cd, calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), trace elements, and some biochemical indicators were measured, and the bone was fixed in a 4% formaldehyde solution for histological observation. Bone marrow cells were isolated to determine the expression of osteoclast‐associated mRNA and proteins. Cd was increased in the blood, urine, and bone in response to Cd in drinking water in a dose‐dependent manner. The content of iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn) was significantly increased, whereas Ca and P were decreased in bone compared to the control group. Cd affected the histological structure of the bone, and induced the upregulation and downregulation of tartrate‐resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP‐5b) and estradiol in the serum, respectively. Cd had no significant effect on the alkaline phosphatase activity in the serum. The expression of osteoclast marker proteins, including TRACP, cathepsin K, matrix metalloprotein 9, and carbonic anhydrases were all increased in the Cd‐treated bone marrow cells. Cd significantly increased the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), but had lower effect on the expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG) in both bone marrow cells and bone tissue. Thus, Cd exposure destroyed the bone microstructure, promoted the formation of osteoclasts in the bone tissue, and accelerated bone resorption, in which the OPG/RANKL pathway may play an important role.},

	abstract = {The aim of the present review is to point out the possible link between boron and osteoporosis. Boron is an element that is essential for plants; however, its importance as an essential nutrient in animals has not yet been accepted and is still being discussed by the scientific community. In both plants and animals, boron is able to form di-esters bridges with cis-diol groups; and one of its functions in the metabolism of human is the hydroxylation of vitamin D until its active form, the Calcitriol. This reaction is performed in the mitochondria of kidney cells where, in addition to a continuous supply of boron,the presence of oxygen, magnesium, NADPH and cytochrome P450 is required. Being an element that the human body cannot synthesize, its ingestion through water and food is very important. There seems to be a relationship between osteoporosis (a chronic, silent and chemotherapeutically treatable disease) and boron levels. Boron supplementation to the diet over the estimated dietary intake of 2 mg/day simulates the action of hormone replacement therapy, helps in the consolidation of fractures, among other benefits. However, attempting to elucidate the etiology of a multifactorial disease such as osteoporosis is an arduous task in research, and the possible link of traces or ultratraces elements, is a hypothesis yet to be addressed.},

	abstract = {Abstract Objective: To review the evidence on diet and nutrition relating to osteoporosis and provide recommendations for preventing osteoporosis, in particular, osteopototic fracture. Approach: Firstly, to review the definition, diagnosis and epidemiology of osteoporosis, to discuss the difficulties in using bone mineral density to define osteoporosis risk in a world-wide context and to propose that fragility fracture should be considered as the disease endpoint. Secondly, to provide an overview of the scientific data, the strengths and weaknesses of the evidence and the conceptual difficulties in interpreting studies linking diet, nutrition and osteoporosis. The following were considered: calcium, vitamin D, phosphorus, magnesium, protein and fluorine. Other potential dietary influences on bone health were also discussed, including vitamins, trace elements, electrolytes, acid–base balance, phyto-oestrogens, vegetarianism and lactose intolerance. Conclusions: There is insufficient knowledge linking bone mineral status, growth rates or bone turnover in children and adolescents to long-term benefits in old age for these indices to be used as markers of osteoporotic disease risk. For adults, the evidence of a link between intakes of any dietary component and fracture risk is not sufficiently secure to make firm recommendations, with the exception of calcium and vitamin D. For other aspects of the diet, accumulating evidence suggests that current healthy-eating advice to decrease sodium intake, to increase potassium intake, and to consume more fresh fruits and vegetables is unlikely to be detrimental to bone health and may be beneficial.},

	abstract = {A quality control (QC) program for bone mineral measurements at the proximal femur by dual‐energy x‐ray absorptiometry (DXA) was designed for the osteoporosis component of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). Major elements of the QC program are (1) a QC center for review of all scans, (2) setup procedures for and continuous monitoring of daily QC procedures, (3) reference standards for cross‐calibration, (4) longitudinal studies for assessment of instrument stability, (5) monitoring of technologist performance, and (6) training. This report describes the results of the QC program of the first half of this 6 year study, which began in 1988. Measurements were performed on 7376 subjects in three mobile examination centers, which traveled to a new location about every 3 months, a total of 44 locations. A small percentage (3.5%) of all scans were rejected, mostly because of patient motion during scanning, but 33% of the remaining scans required reanalysis at the QC center to refine the location of the regions of interest. Precision in spine and hip phantoms was below 1% at all ROIs. In 535 subjects with duplicate scans, age 20–91 of both sexes, examined in a blinded review, precision for BMD at the femur neck ROI was 3.2% (CV) and 5.1% for Ward's triangle BMD. The central review improved scan quality, increased the number of usable scans, and reduced significantly the range of the mean percentage difference in the duplicate scans. Minor alterations in machine function were observed and corrected. QC results on phantoms were similar to those obtained with stationary instruments in dedicated laboratories. Retrospective analysis of the regression slopes from QC records did not show a need for correction of the data base, indicating that the instruments were stable during the course of the study.},

We also examined the relationships between the concentrations of these metals in the knee joint and the influence of varied factors on the concentration of Fe, Ni, Mo, and V. The study of these trace elements is important, because these elements are used alone and in combination in diet supplements, and they are components of biomaterials implanted in medicine. The study materials, consisting of the spongy bone, cartilage, meniscus, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), and infrapatellar fat pad, were obtained from 34 women and 12 men from northwestern Poland. The concentrations of Ni, Fe, Mo, and V were determined using spectrophotometric atomic absorption in inductively coupled argon plasma (ICP-AES). We found significantly higher Mo concentrations in the ACL of women than men. There was a significant difference in the Mo concentration in the spongy bone between patients from cities with fewer than 100,000 inhabitants and patients from cities with more than 100,000 residents. Iron concentrations in the spongy bone were higher in non-smoking patients and those who did not consume alcohol. Vanadium concentrations were higher in the infrapatellar fat pads in abstainers. In patients who had not undergone arthroscopy surgery, V concentration was lower in cartilage. The concentrations of V in the cartilage and infrapatellar fat pad were higher in osteoporotic patients than in non-osteoporotic patients. There were significant differences in Fe concentrations in the meniscus, with the lowest in osteoporotic patients. We noted lower Mo concentrations in the spongy bone of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, we noted some new interactions among metals in the studied structures of the knee joint. The results reported in this study show the influence of gender, place of residence, smoking, consumption of alcohol, arthroscopy surgery, osteoporosis, and rheumatoid arthritis on the Fe, Ni, Mo, and V concentrations in the studied structures of the knee joint.},

	abstract = {Background. Low bone mass (LBM) in the form of osteopenia (Op) and osteoporosis (OP) is one of the most pres sing public health problems. Рostmenopausal period in women is considered the main risk factor for the development of the pathological process. Objective of the research was to assess the clinical and pathogenetic features of LBM in women with menopause. Materials and methods. 261 non-menstruating women with an average age of 48 years were observed, physiological menopause occurred in 91 % of cases, and pathological in the rest. Exclusion criteria were women with inflammatory rheumatic diseases of the joints, oncological pathology, diseases of the blood system and thyroid gland, who received glucocorticoid hormones and anticonvulsants. In 133 (51 %) women, LBM (main group) was established in the ratio Op and ОР 4 : 1; diagnosis being made by the methods of conventional radiography and densitometry. Among the markers of bone metabolism, the following were used: blood levels of parathyrin (parathyroid hormone), calcitonin, osteocalcin, osteopontin, alkaline phosphatase, and osteo-associated chemical elements. During the examination, biochemical, enzyme immunoassay, atomic emission and atomic absorption methods were used. Results. The age of women correlates with the parameters of bone mineral density, and the LBM in all ca ses is associated with high blood levels of osteocalcin, in 1/2 of them — osteopontin, depends on the presence of comorbid primary arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and leukocytoclastic vasculitis. OP formation significantly differs from Op in higher blood levels of parathyrin (by 47 %), alkaline phosphatase (by 19 %), phosphorus (by 9 %) and lead (by 27 %), but lower calcium values (by 4 %), moreover, the acti vity of alkaline phosphatase has predictive negative significance in relation to the severity of the LBM. Calcitonin, magnesium, strontium and zinc also participate in the pathogenetic constructions of the latter. Conclusions. LBM develops in every second postmenopau sal woman, and the further development of pathogenetic therapy should be aimed at correcting the concentration of osteocalcin and osteopontin in the body, and inhibition of alkaline phosphatase activity may be a criterion for the effectiveness of therapeutic measures.},

	abstract = {Osteoporotic bone fracture is a significant public health problem. Therefore, it has attracted several physicians and biomedical researchers’ attention. The main objective of this study is to predict hip fracture location under various loading conditions. The use of bone densitometry in clinics to evaluate and predict osteoporosis has been expanded. Therefore, in this research, finite element analysis is carried out using models based on images and reports of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry system to predict the femoral fracture pattern. Initially, the finite element models were created based on the bone mineral density reported in four distinct regions including neck, greater trochanter, inter trochanter, and total hip. To improve the accuracy of predictions, the pixel by pixel bone mineral density map was extracted based on the raw data of the HOLOGIC bone densitometry device. Linear finite element analysis was performed using the maximum risk factor, which has been defined based on the ratio of the strain energy density to the yield strain energy density, and thus the location of femoral fractures was determined based on the location of critical elements. The results demonstrate that using the non-homogeneous distribution of bone mineral density in a finite element analysis of the 2D models based on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can be considered as a useful tool for predicting the location of the bone fracture.},

	abstract = {Selenium (Se) apart from iodine, iron and calcium is one of the nutrient-derived key elements strongly impacting the endocrine system. However, no specific hormonal 'feedback' regulation for Se status has yet been identified in contrast to the fine-tuned hormone network regulating the Ca 2+ and phosphate balance or the hepcidin-related iron status.Since its discovery as an essential trace element, effects of Se excess or deficiency on the endocrine system or components of the hypothalamic-pituitary-periphery feedback circuits, the thyroid hormone axis, glucoregulatory and adrenal hormones, male and female gonads, the musculo-skeletal apparatus and skin have been identified. Analysis of the Se status in the blood or via validated biomarkers such as the hepatically-derived Selenoprotein P provides valuable diagnostic insight and a rational basis for decision making on required therapeutic or preventive supplementation of risk groups or patients. Endocrine-related epidemiological and interventional evidence linking Se status to beneficial or potentially adverse actions of selected selenoproteins mediating most of the (patho-) physiological effects are discusssed in this minireview. Autoimmune thyroid disease, diabetes and obesity, male fertility as well as osteoporosis are examples for which observational or interventional studies indicated Se effects. The currently prevailing concept relating Se and selenoproteins to "oxidative stress", reactive oxygen species (ROS), radical hypotheses and related strategies of pharmacological approaches based on various selenium compounds will not be in the focus. The crucial biological function of several selenoproteins in cellular redox-regulation and specific enzyme reactions in endocrine pathways will be addressed and put in clinical perspective.},

Воробьева, 2020 31 MEDITSINSKIY SOVET H ea lt hy c hi ld 2020;(1):30–40 ВВЕДЕНИЕ Соединительнотканная дисплазия (СТД) – это группа полиморфных патологических состояний, обусловленных наследственными или врожденными дефектами синтеза коллагена и сопровождающихся нарушением функций опорно-двигательного аппарата и внутренних органов. СТД включает генетически обусловленные дифференцированные синдромы (синдром Марфана, Элерса – Данло, несовершенный остеогенез, синдром Билса, синдром Стиклера и др.) и недифференцированную дисплазию соединительной ткани (НДСТ), которая также имеет генетическую основу, но проявляется под влиянием мультифакториальных воздействий в эмбриональном и постнатальном периодах. Распространенность синдромных форм невелика. Так, частота синдрома Марфана в популяции – 1:10000– 1:15000 [1]. Популяционная частота НДСТ в России составляет 8,5%, однако отдельные ее признаки определяются у 60–70% населения. У детей в популяции НДСТ наблюдается у 20–70% [2–4]. В источниках иностранных авторов данные о распространенности НДСТ отсутствуют. НДСТ из-за полиморфизма клинических проявлений стала междисциплинарной проблемой, касающейся не только педиатров, но и врачей других специальностей (ревматологов, кардиологов, ортопедов, гастроэнтерологов и т.д.). К сожалению, практические врачи недостаточно информированы о сущности НДСТ, о распознавании ее признаков даже при первом осмотре, следствием чего является отсутствие грамотных конкретных рекомендаций пациенту по физической активности, лечению, профилактике прогрессирования дисплазии соединительной ткани. Клинические проявления НДСТ чрезвычайно многообразны (табл. 1). Динамика признаков НДСТ имеет прогредиентный характер, в основном до 35-летнего возраста. В раннем возрасте симптоматика НДСТ минимальна: в возрасте 4–5 лет начинают формироваться пролапсы клапанов сердца; в 5–7 лет – деформации грудной клетки и позвоночника, плоскостопие, миопия; в подростковом и молодом возрасте – гипермобильность суставов, вегетативная дисфункция, сосудистый синдром [1, 5, 6]. Критическим периодом является подростковый возраст, когда прирост количества признаков дисплазии соединительной ткани максимален, что обусловлено «скачком» роста с увеличением общей массы соединительной ткани. В возрасте старше 35 лет риск появления нового признака НДСТ маловероятен и основную проблему составляют осложнения дисплазии (варикоз вен, тромбофлебит, привычные вывихи, пролапсы клапанов 2–3 ст., дивертикулярная болезнь кишечника и т.д.)1 [1, 3, 5]. 1 Патология соединительной ткани – причина большинства болезней.

	abstract = {Major Compulsory Revisions: Question 2 was not fully addressed. The authors did not explain why cupper was not evaluated. Moreover, despite their role in chronic disease prevention, both magnesium and folate are not considered as dietary antioxidants. Please see Bae and Choi Biol Trace Elem Res. 2010 Oct 27. [Epub ahead of print] and even the review cited by the authors (Clinical Nutrition (2005) 24, 172–183). Therefore, the ref# 14 did not support the idea that magnesium and folate merit particular attention. If there are studies that specifically describe and support folate as an antioxidant, they should be cited in the 4th paragraph (introduction section). Question 4 was also not fully addressed. The authors did not explain if subjects using dietary supplements were excluded. Furthermore, the authors should describe the statistic method used to correct possible confounders. Question 13: the text is confusing. The authors state that " With the exception of vitamin C there were no significant differences in intakes of all nutrients between genders." However, they describe next that "Men had a higher mean intake of most elements (vitamin E, folate, zinc and magnesium), while women had higher intakes of vitamin A and selenium (Table 2)". If the author want to publish the manuscript, this kind of information should be correct. Moreover it seems that the manuscript was not revised by the authors before send it to the journal which is definitly unacceptable.},

	title = {Nutritional deficiencies after bariatric surgery},
	doi = {10.1038/nrendo.2012.48},
	year = {2012},
	abstract = {Lifestyle intervention programmes often produce insufficient weight loss and poor weight loss maintenance. As a result, an increasing number of patients with obesity and related comorbidities undergo bariatric surgery, which includes approaches such as the adjustable gastric band or the 'divided' Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). This Review summarizes the current knowledge on nutrient deficiencies that can develop after bariatric surgery and highlights follow-up and treatment options for bariatric surgery patients who develop a micronutrient deficiency. The major macronutrient deficiency after bariatric surgery is protein malnutrition. Deficiencies in micronutrients, which include trace elements, essential minerals, and water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins, are common before bariatric surgery and often persist postoperatively, despite universal recommendations on multivitamin and mineral supplements. Other disorders, including small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, can promote micronutrient deficiencies, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus. Recognition of the clinical presentations of micronutrient deficiencies is important, both to enable early intervention and to minimize long-term adverse effects. A major clinical concern is the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and the development of metabolic bone diseases, such as osteoporosis or osteomalacia; metabolic bone diseases may explain the increased risk of hip fracture in patients after RYGB. Further studies are required to determine the optimal levels of nutrient supplementation and whether postoperative laboratory monitoring effectively detects nutrient deficiencies. In the absence of such data, clinicians should inquire about and treat symptoms that suggest nutrient deficiencies.},

	title = {PERSPECTIVES FOR DUAL-ENERGY COMPUTER TOMOGRAPHY IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF LOW-ENERGY SPINAL FRACTURES},
	year = {2019},
	abstract = {Abstract: Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease characterized by disturbed microarchitecture and reduced bone mass. The basic diagnostic test of osteoporosis is densitometry, which determines the bone mineral density. Densitometric examination is based on the statistical result in relation to bone density of young people (T-score) or people of the same age (Z-score). It has been arbitrarily assumed that a T-score equal to or greater than –2.5 SD means osteoporosis. However, Clinical practice shows that patients with a relatively normal densitometry score may be affected by low-energy fractures. The two-energy computer tomograph (DECT) method gives an insight into the chemical composition of bones, depending on the software used, one can determine the X-ray absorption coefficient for the given elements: calcium, chlorine, phosphorus. The DECT method seems to be a great diagnostic tool for assessing the microarchitecture of bone tissue with reduced bone mass. Goal : The aim of the work is an objective assessment of the DECT value in the diagnosis of osteoporosis, and the determination of the method value for the probability of occurrence of low-energy fracture in patients with osteoporosis. The DECT study has a much greater value in the diagnosis of osteoporosis from classical densitometry. The DECT study allows to consider the loss of bone structure in each vertebra individually as opposed to the densitometric examination. The DECT study shows the absolute values  of the X-ray absorption coefficient of hydroxyapatite in contrast to the statistical method used in densitometry. The DECT study shows that osteoporosis is not linear and generalized in all skeletal structures in the same way. Our study shows that a larger loss of bone mass and a larger disruption of the vertebral body architecture occurs in the stems of the higher lumbosacral segment, i. e. L2–L3 relative to the L4 and lower stems.},

Bioactive glasses have been synthesized with improved properties exhibiting promising prospects to restore bone defects and to reduce bone alterations. This study aims in evaluating the performance therapy of nano-bioglass (NBG). In vivo, after rat 60 Co y -radiation, the tissue wound healing process was studied by grafting NBG material in rat femoral condyle tissue. An improved mechanical property was noticed (31.11 ± 5.0 HV) when compared with that of BG-implanted group (24.16 ± 4.9 HV). On the other hand, a rise in Ca and P ion concentrations in the implanted microenvironment was shown to lead to the formation/deposition of Ca–P phases. Trace elements, such as Mg and Zn, were detected in the newly formed bone and involved in bone healing. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidases (GTT) in groups implanted with NBG show no significant variation for all time of implantation. Serum creatinine maintains their normal levels in the implanted groups in different time of implantation. The histomorphometric parameters of bone tissue showed amelioration in NBG-treated rats. Moreover, no hepatocyte or renal necrosis was noticed. Additionally, no remarkable change in the tissue morphology was shown. Our findings suggested that NBG might have promising potential applications for wound healing.},

	year = {2011},
	abstract = {This study was conducted to find out the multiple uses of eggshells in nutrition and medicine. Eggshells can be utilized for various purposes that minimize their effect on environmental pollution. Eggshells present healthy, balanced calcium due to its trace amounts of other minerals and is probably the best natural source of calcium. One whole medium sized eggshell makes about one teaspoon of powder, which yields about 750-800 mgs of elemental calcium plus other micro elements. Eggshell powder has been reported to increase bone mineral density in people and animals with osteoporosis. In laying hens in the late production phase, eggshell powder has been found to increase egg production and improve the quality of shells. Discarded eggshells are often used as a plant fertilizer and are effective liming sources. This is because eggshells contain calcium that raises, or neutralizes, the pH level of overly acidic soil. Chicken eggshells can be used as an alternative soil stabilizer like lime since they have the same chemical composition. Such stabilized soil can be used as subgrade materials in road construction works. Eggshell membrane consists of collagen as a component. Collagen is a type of protein, fibrous in nature that connects and supports other bodily tissues, such as skin, bone, tendons, muscles and cartilage. Collagen has been isolated mainly from bovine and swine skins and bones Collagen used in medicine, biochemical, pharmaceutical, food and cosmetics industries. After the outbreaks of bovine spongioform encephalopathy, foot and mouth disease, autoimmune and allergic reactions, restrictions on collagen uses from these sources were enforced. Eggshell membrane collagen is very low in autoimmune and allergic reactions as well as high in bio-safety and is of similar characteristics to other mammalian collagen. Eggshells/shell membranes have multiple uses in nutrition, medicine, construction and art works.},

	year = {2018},
	abstract = {Silicon is one of the essential trace elements in the human body; the deficiency of which may lead to bone diseases. Numerous animal experiments have shown that an appropriate increase in the intake of silicon is beneficial to enhancing bone density and toughness to prevent osteoporosis. However, the molecular mechanisms of the silicon-mediated osteogenesis process have not been sufficiently clarified. In this study, we determined the possible osteogenesis-related mechanisms of orthosilicic acid at a molecular level. We detected the relevant pathway and osteogenic indicators by immunofluorescence (IF), Western blot, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining (using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium [BCIP/NBT]), ALP enzyme labeling method, osteocalcin (OCN), and N-terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen (P1NP) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that orthosilicic acid is capable of enhancing the expression of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K), phospho-protein kinase B (P-Akt), phospho-mammalian target of rapamycin (P-mTOR), and related osteogenic markers (runt-related transcription factor 2 [RUNX2], type I collagen [COL1], ALP, OCN, and P1NP). However, with the addition of PI3K–Akt–mTOR pathway-specific inhibitor LY294002, the expression of PI3K, P-Akt, P-mTOR, RUNX2, COL1, ALP, OCN, and P1NP decreased. The results indicated that the PI3K–Akt–mTOR pathway played a positive regulatory role in the process of orthosilicic acid–mediated osteogenesis in vitro.},

	title = {Critical points in strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis.},
	year = {2009},
	abstract = {Current treatment decisions for osteoporosis depend on the fracture risk calculated based on the results of comprehensive diagnostic procedures [clinical risk factors (CRF), densitometry (BMD), morphometry, and bone turnover markers (BTM)]. Recently developed fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX) represents an important new achievement as a 10-year fracture risk calculation based on femoral neck densitometry and age combined with independent clinical fracture risk factors. FRAX presents several options: FRAX BMI (body mass index) is advocated as a helpful screening tool to identify the group of patients with high fracture risk, independently of access to densitometry and FRAX, utilizing hip densitometry. In both cases, the probability of major fractures or hip fractures are calculated during performed diagnostic evaluations. Operating FRAX algorithm does not include spinal bone mineral density, which is its main limitation. With the aim of improvement of anti-fracture efficacy of therapeutic management of osteoporosis, we have extended our discussion to three integral elements of existent strategy: 1) screening outlines, 2) principles of drug selection, and 3) treatment benefit evaluation. Since osteoporosis is a chronic disease, long-term adherence to the treatment is important. The suitability of the drug, the patient's preference, tolerability, and convenience should all be considered. Anti-catabolic drugs are most appropriate in patients with high bone turnover, while anabolic drugs demonstrate efficacy irrespective of bone turnover. BMD measurement is most widely used for long-term assessment of the efficacy of osteoporosis treatment. The measurements of bone turnover markers (BTMs) can be considered a useful shortterm (at 3 months) monitoring tool in selected patients. In both BTM and BMD, the least significant change (LSC) method should be used for interpretation of the results. Fractures are not a reliable clinical endpoint for evaluating the effectiveness of therapy in individual patients because of their stochastic nature. If fractures occur, however, the need for drug change and additional non-pharmacological treatment (fall prevention, balance training, muscle strengthening) should always be considered.},

It is quite different from the Itai-itai disease and osteoporosis. In 2001, an 8-year-old boy from a small town in Xinjiang was found to get GSS disease. Some parts of his bones vanished without any external force. Results showed that the concentrations of Cd and Cu, especially Na and K in his hair were far higher than those of the healthy people, and the concentration of Cd was 2 times that of the reference while those of Cr and Zn were insufficient for health. The ratio of K/Na was also higher than that of healthy group. Four different ratios revealed weak bone growth potential and strong bone breakage occurred simultaneously in the GSS sufferer’s skeletal system. It might be the synergistic effect of the trace elements leading to the baffling syndrome. Further investigation demonstrated that the trace elements can cause a series of diseases, including GSS disease and a typical rheumatoid arthritis (ARA). Epidemiological investigation also proved that there were about 25% of the inhabitants in the town suffered from an ARA. All of these data implied there was significant relationship among Gorham-Stout Syndrome, ARA and prolapse of lumbar intervertebral disc.},

	year = {2020},
	abstract = {Abstract Mounting evidence is revealing that heavy metals can incur disordered bone homeostasis, leading to the development of degenerative bone diseases, including osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, degenerative disk disease, and osteomalacia. Meanwhile, heavy metal‐induced anemia has been found to be intertwined with degenerative bone diseases. However, the relationship and interplay among these adverse outcomes remain elusive. Thus, it is of importance to shed light on the modes of action (MOAs) and adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) responsible for degenerative bone diseases and anemia under exposure to heavy metals. In the current Review, the epidemiological and experimental findings are recapitulated to interrogate the contributions of heavy metals to degenerative bone disease development which may be attributable dependently and independently to anemia. A few likely mechanisms are postulated for anemia‐independent degenerative bone diseases, including dysregulated osteogenesis and osteoblastogenesis, imbalanced bone formation and resorption, and disturbed homeostasis of essential trace elements. By contrast, remodeled bone microarchitecture, inhibited erythropoietin production, and disordered iron homeostasis are speculated to account for anemia‐associated degenerative bone disorders upon heavy metal exposure. Together, this Review aims to elaborate available literature to fill in the knowledge gaps in understanding the detrimental effects of heavy metals on bone cells and bone homeostasis through different perspectives.},

	year = {2006},
	abstract = {Summary Chronic diseases pose a challenge for physicians, since rates of adherence to the prescribed treatment are low and deteriorate with time. Osteoporosis is no exception to this rule. The percentage of patients adhering to antiresortive treatment (hormone replacement, raloxifene, or bisphosphonates) falls substantially during the first year, and continues to decrease thereafter. Non-adherent patients show less inhibition of bone turnover, less gain of bone mineral density, and greater fracture risk. This represents increased costs for the health system, specially due to higher hospitalization rates. There are no useful clinical factors for the prediction of adherence, but any effective strategy to improve it should consider a better patient-doctor relationship, monitoring attendance to scheduled clinic visits, and the use of objective elements to monitor the response to treatment (biochemical markers, bone densitometry). Besides, a simpler therapeutic regimen should improve both adherence and the response to treatment.},

The aim of this study was to present data from the association of plasma zinc, copper and toxic elements of lead and cadmium levels with bone mineral density in Iranian women. 135 women gave their information and enrolled. Fasting plasma was used for measurement of trace elements and heavy metals by Differential Pulse Anodic Stripping Voltammetry. Control group (n = 51) were normal in both lumbar spine (L1-L4) and femoral neck density (T-score ≥ -1), but just femoral neck T-score was considered as criterion in selection of patient group (n = 49, Tscore < -1). No differences were found in the nutritional status, number of diseases, drugs and functional activities between these groups. Plasma Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd levels were analyzed by, a method of voltammetry. Mean ± SD levels of copper and zinc was 1.168 ± 0.115, 1.097 ± 0.091 μg/ml in control group, 1.394 ± 0.133, 1.266 ± 0.11 μg/ml in total patient (TP) and 1.237 ± 0.182, 1.127 ± 0.176 μg/ml in Mild patients(-1 > T-score > -1.7), 1.463 ± 0.174, 1.327 ± 0.147 μg/ml in Severe patient group (T-score < -1.7); respectively.

Trace elements are naturally occurring and its daily requirement as dietary supplement form is only a few milligrams and even micrograms. They are categorized as essential and non-essential, and that is based upon their biological action, diseases that occur due to their deficiency and toxicity due to overdose. Use of herbal medicines is now increasing worldwide because of their minimal side effects. In general, Haritaki (T. chebula) acts as a blood purifier and prevents haemorrhage. It is also used as an internal cleanser by removing harmful toxins and excess fats out of the body. It can strengthen the hair roots and enriches hair color. The elements were determined quantitatively using the modern technique of ICP-OES. The extracts undertaken for this study contains Ca as a primary elemental content, and its concentration is found to be as high as 144 mg/kg in comparison with other macro elements. Ca helps to overcome the problems of high blood pressure, heart attack, premenstrual syndrome, and colon cancer, besides its ability to keep the bones healthy and to reduce the risk of osteoporosis. Other essential elements such as Fe (2.0732 mg/kg), Zn (1.0235 mg/kg), and Mn (0.2500 mg/kg) were also present but not to an appreciable amount in the extracts of T. chebula. It was concluded that due to soil nature, climatic condition, time of harvest could be a detrimental factor while reviewing the elemental profile.},

	abstract = {Purpose of reviewIn the context of the worldwide obesity epidemic, bariatric surgery is the only therapy associated with a sustainable weight loss and to midterm prevention of obesity-related complications. However, nutritional and behavioral multidisciplinary medical preparation, as well as long-term postoperative nutritional follow-up, is strongly advised to avoid postoperative surgical, nutritional, or psychiatric complications. Recent findingsDue to a long history of restrictive diets and large body weight fluctuations, preoperative nutritional assessment and correction of vitamin and trace elements deficiencies are mandatory. A rapid and massive weight loss induces the loss of muscle mass and fat-free mass that could lead to malnutrition and osteoporosis. Dietetic counseling is advised to prevent postoperative food intolerance syndrome, malnutrition, and weight regain. Protein intake should be at least 60 g/day. Planned and structured physical exercise should be systematically promoted to maintain muscle mass and bone health. SummaryBariatric surgery is mostly successful if patients are well prepared and monitored. The perfect patients’ selection remains difficult in the absence of well defined predictive criteria of success. Future research is needed to define optimal perioperative nutritional management and its influence on long-term outcome, including quality of life and healthcare-related costs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The urgent tasks of experimental balneology are to design and investigate of the action of native mineral waters (MW) enriched with essential trace elements in order to improve their therapeutic and prophylactic effects. OBJECTIVE To investigate the mechanisms of direct action of the cycle intake of Essentuki MWs modified with selenium (Essentuki Novaya - MW1, Essentuki No. 4 - MW2) on healthy animals. MATERIAL AND METHODS According to the experimental conditions, 102 male albino rats were divided into 7 groups using a simple randomization method. Group 1 (n=15) received only drinking water (DW) (a control group); Group 2 (n=13) used native MW1; Group 3 (n=13) took native MW2; Group 4 (n=15) had MW1 with selenium (MW1Se1 - 3 mcg/kg); Group 5 (n=15) received MW1Se2; Group 6 (n=15) had MW2Se1 - 300 mcg/kg; and Group 7 (n=16) used MW2Se2. RESULTS After cycle drinking, the body weight of the animals in the experimental groups did not significantly differ from that in the control group and was determined within the normal species range. X-ray densitometry showed that the body fat composition in the rats was lower than the control values only after MW1Se1, MW1Se2, and MW2Se1 cycles. The rat lipid spectrum in different groups displayed differences: the atherogenic index was low after MW1, MW1Se1, and MW1Se2 cycles. The blood glucose levels increased in the rats after drinking native MWs (F=2.7; p=0.01). After selenium-modified MW cycles, the blood glucose levels corresponded to the control values. The blood of experimental and control animals showed no differences in bone mineral density (BMD), levels of hormones (insulin, thyroxine, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and end products of protein metabolism. Selenium-modified Essentuki No. 4 changed the orientation of functional relationships from negative to positive ones between glucose and BMD. CONCLUSION The findings suggest that cycle drinking with native and selenium-enriched Essentuki MWs differently affect the animals. The Essentuki Novaya MW (MW1, MW1Se1, and MW1Se2) drinking cycles predominantly affected in reducing blood atherogenic lipids. The volume of an animal fat component was lower after selenium-modified Essentuki Novaya and Essentuki No. 4 water (MW1Se1, MW1Se2, and MW2Se1) cycles. A direct relationship between DHEA and BMD was found in animals after using the selenium-enriched Essentuki No. 4 cycle.},

	doi = {10.1007/s10856-009-3789-y},
	year = {2009},
	abstract = {Controlled delivery of active ions from biomaterials has become critical in bone regeneration. Some silica-based materials, in particular bioactive glasses, have received much attention due to the ability of their dissolution products to promote cell proliferation, cell differentiation and activate gene expression. However, many of these materials offer little therapeutic potential for diseased tissue. Incorporating trace elements, such as zinc and strontium, known to have beneficial and therapeutic effects on bone may provide a more viable bone graft option for those suffering from metabolic bone diseases such as osteoporosis. Rational compositional design may also allow for controlled release of these active ions at desirable dose levels in order to enhance therapeutic efficacy. In this study, six differing compositions of calcium–strontium–sodium–zinc–silicate (Ca–Sr–Na–Zn–Si) glass bone grafts were immersed in pH 7.4 and pH 3 solutions to study the effect of glass composition on zinc and strontium release in a normal and extreme physiological environment. The zinc release levels over 30 days for all zinc-containing glasses in the pH 7.4 solution were 3.0–7.65 ppm. In the more acidic pH 3 environment, the zinc levels were higher (89–750 ppm) than those reported to be beneficial and may produce cytotoxic or negative effects on bone tissue. Strontium levels released from all examined glasses in both pH environments similarly fell within apparent beneficial ranges—7.5–3500 ppm. Glass compositions with identical SrO content but lower ZnO:Na2O ratios, showed higher levels of Sr2+ release. Whereas, zinc release from zinc-containing glasses appeared related to ZnO compositional content. Sustainable strontium and zinc release was seen in the pH 7.4 environment up to day 7. These results indicate that the examined Ca–Sr–Na–Zn–Si glass compositions show good potential as therapeutic bone grafts, and that the graft composition can be tailored to allow therapeutic levels of ions to be released.},

	year = {2016},
	abstract = {The bone is a mineral reserve for metabolic requirements and eggshell formation as well as providing support to the bodies of birds. Bone weakness in laying hens has caused many problems such as bone deformation, osteoporosis, cage layer fatigue and fractures. These problems result in economic losses and are detrimental to animal welfare. Breaking strength is a good indicator of the health and strength of bone and an increase in breaking strength in laying hens would be important to decrease economic losses and improve the welfare of animals. One of the main factors affecting bone breaking strength is nutrition, as it is closely related to dietary calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D and particle size of the calcium source, particularly when the dietary calcium is insufficient. It has been accepted that the composition of the diet, trace elements, especially boron, vitamins, and feed additives play important roles in maintaining bone health and improving the breaking strength of bone in laying hens. This article reviews the results of studies in laying hens wherein the effect of nutrition on the breaking strength of bone were examined.},

	abstract = {Increasingly, bone health and fragility fracture prevention is one of the most important aspects of healthy aging that we, as women’s health care providers (HCPs), must be sure is part of our thought process in caring for women at midlife and beyond. Virtually all ObGyn HCPs are aware of breast health, both in terms of the clinical breast exam and imaging surveillance. The 5-year relative survival rate for “localized breast cancer” is 99%. Most recent data on hip fracture, however, indicate that it is associated with a mortality in the first year of 21%! We need to be sure that our patients understand this. Previously, this column provided an update on osteoporosis. In 2016, I asked to change the focus to “Update on bone health” to highlight that simply relying on dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) testing of bone mass with arbitrary cutoffs for osteoporosis, osteopenia, and normal bone mass is not adequate for improving overall bone health. The addition of the FRAX fracture risk assessment tool, now widely employed, as well as the trabecular bone score (TBS), not widely employed, helps to refine the assessment of patients’ risk status. Further, issues such as sarcopenia, adequate dietary calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and fall prevention (improving balance, use of nonskid rugs in the bathroom, avoiding black ice when present, having nothing to slip on between the bed and the bathroom in the middle of the night, and so on) also are essential elements of “bone health.” Finally, I cannot stress enough the importance of developing a good relationship with whatever facility one uses for DXA testing in order to maximize use of the reports and potential limitations. In addition, we should identify a metabolic bone specialist for referral of unusual cases or patients who require medications unlikely to be prescribed by us as ObGyns, and develop some familiarity with therapies that may be utilized.

	title = {From diagnosing and monitoring deer populations to explaining human osteoporosis: research in composition, Mechanics and histology of antlers},
	year = {2012},
	abstract = {Hunting is increasingly becoming an important economic activity and a new source of high-quality tourism. Deer is probably the main large game species hunting for trophy, and also farmed partly for antlers worldwide. Russia has 8 out of the 12 million deer in the world, but intensive manage-ment and monitoring of deer is more often done in Europe (particularly Spain) and New Zealand. Deer antler is a costly bone struc-ture that constitutes 1 to 5% of body weight (Huxley, 1931), and about 24% of the weight of the skeleton (Gomez et al., submitted). Males must resorb minerals from their own skeleton for antler growth (Baxter et al., 1999) and thus, we postulated that antlers should show the physiological effort made to grow each part of the antler in the mineral composition, mechanical properties of the bone material, struc-ture and histology. Because males make their maximum effort to grow antlers to gain access to food and fe-males, males in better condition, nutri-tion, etc. should show differ in antler characteristics from males of lower quality or worse health. Finally, as minerals cannot be created by plants and reflect availability in soil, antlers should show mineral deficiencies. Our group has been the first to un-dergo a series of studies showing that chemical composition of antler in standard conditions conveys a large amount of information that could be useful both for game management, and may have possible implications for bone medicine. Our first study showed that antler bone chemical composi-tion varies with antler region (Landete-Castillejos et al., 2007a). The same study showed that the chemical composition of a few minerals could explain 77% of the variability in length and size of the antler, which in effect means that there is a specific composition of high and low quality antlers. Finally, in agreement with the hypothesis that chemical composition might be an index of male quality, we also found that there was an influence of deer body size and growth (particularly during lactation) in ash, Ca, P, K and Na, but not on Mg, Fe or Zn (Landete-Castillejos et al., 2007a). We also compared antlers from two very differently managed populations to assess if antlers reflect quality of management: captive, well-fed, health-managed deer, and free-ranging deer with lower food quality and no health treatment (Landete-Castillejos et al., 2007b). The results showed significant and clear divergent trends supporting that antlers reflect nutrition and better condition of farmed deer. Thus, as Figures 1 and 2 show, cortical thickness recovers in the top half of well-fed deer antlers, whilst it fails to do that in free-ranging deer under poor quality food and no health treatment. Na and other minerals (Mg, not shown) show that composition remains stable in deer under a high-quality diet, but it is reduced as the antler grows in free-ranging deer with a poorer nutrition. Another study comparing the mean composition of the antler with the ratios of feed in farmed vs. free-ranging deer showed that the composition of the antler reflects that of the diet (Es-tevez et al., 2009). Studies under review (Olguin et al., submitted) show that internal bones in deer (femurs of hinds) reflects the composition of the diet in trace elements such as Zn, Mn, or Cu, but not in major minerals such as P or Na. A follow-up of the study comparing farmed deer vs. free ranging antlers showed that the mechanical properties of the antler material are worse in an-imals with poorer nutrition and that the curves are similar to those of miner-als (Landete-Castillejos et al., 2007c). The results also suggest that there is an association between bone chemical composition and mechanical proper-ties independently of ash content, so that a lower percent of K, Zn, Si, Fe, and greater percent of Na and Mg occurs in stronger and stiffer antler mate-rial.

The sol-id line is for farmed, well-fed (18% protein), parasite-free deer showing a recovery in cortical thickess for the second half of the antler, and a constant content of Na. The dotted line corresponds to antlers of free-ranging deer with low-er food quality (6-7% protein) and no health treatments.},

Calcium, proteins, and vitamin D are the best investigated nutrients, protein- and vitamin D-deficiency becoming frequent with advancing age, vitamin K, trace elements, and phosphorus having additional effects. Excessive intake of animal proteins leads to bone loss via acidotic stimulation of osteoclastic bone resorption, and high salt intake enhances negative calcium balance by increasing renal calcium losses. Dairy products offer an equilibrated Calcium and protein intake, but have to be monitored for their fat content. Adequate nutrition in childhood influences positively bone mass in adulthood, while nutritional supplementation in elderlies can even increase bone mass.},

	abstract = {Osteoporosis, currently considered a major health problem, is a mutifactorial diseas. The role of trace elements, particularly of zinc in osteoporosis has gained recent interest since the skeleton contains the major portion of total body zinc and zinc is indicated to be essential trace element in bone metabolism. This study was designed to evaluate the zinc status and its importance in diagnosis of osteoportic patients. The patient group consisted of 25 women with postme­ nopausal age between 4-11 years while the control groups comprised 18 healthy premenopausal women with a regular period of menstuation and 10 healthy postmenopausal women. Bone mineral density (BMD) (g/cm2) of L2-L4 lumbar vertebrae at anterior-posterior position and L2-L3 lumbar vertebrae at lateral position, along with proximal femur (femoral neck, the greater trochanter and Ward's triangle) were measured using a dual photon absorptiometer (DPA) . BMD was determined to be significantly lower in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in comparison to both the premenopau­ sal and postmenopausal control group(p<0.01). Zinc levels in serum and 24 h urine in addition to routine biochemical parameters including alkaline phosphotase, calcium (in serum and 24 h urine), inorganic phosphorus, magnesium along with parathormone, thyroid stimulating hormone and osteocalcin were estimated in all of the cases to eliminate the causes for secondary osteoprosis. The only parameter that showed significant variation was zinc in 24 h urine which increased both in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis and in postmenopausal healthy women in comparison to the premenopausal healthy controls (p<0.01). The elevation in zinc excretion in postmenopausal osteoporotic patients was significant also compared to the age matched postmenopausal healthy group (p<0.01) implying hyperzincuria as a marker of osteoporosis.

Calcium phosphates (CaPs) are widely used in bone tissue engineering strategies as they have similarities to bone apatite except for the absence of trace elements (TEs) in the CaPs. Bioactive glasses (BGs) have also been used successfully in clinic for craniomaxillofacial and dental applications during the last two decades due to their excellent potential for bonding with bone and inducing osteoblastic differentiation. In this study, we evaluated the osteogenic effects of the ionic dissolution products of the quaternary Si-Sr-Zn-Mg-codoped CaP (TEs-CaP) or 45S5 Bioglass® (45S5 BG), both as mixtures and separately, on rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (rOMSCs \& rMSCs) from osteoporotic and normal animals, using an MTT test and Alizarin Red S staining. The materials enhanced cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation, especially the combination of the BG and TEs-CaP. Analysis by quantitative PCR and ELISA indicated that the expression of osteogenic-specific genes and proteins were elevated. These investigations suggest that the TEs-CaP and 45S5 BG operate synergistically to create an extracellular environment that promotes proliferation and terminal osteogenic differentiation of both osteoporotic and normal rMSCs.},

	abstract = {AIM To review the published literature reporting bone loss in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) particularly those studies using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) methods. METHODS This literature review examines the reported bone mass in patients with ax-SpA, particularly those using the DXA methods. The MEDLINE, Web of Science and Scopus databases were searched for relevant articles published between September 1992 and November 2013. Some of used search terms were ankylosing spondylitis (AS), SpA, spondyloarthropathy, bone loss, bone mass, osteopenia, bone mineral density, osteoporosis (OP), densitometry. Studies in which bone loss was investigated by using DXA in patients with SpA were eligible. Each article was reviewed and the key elements were noted. RESULTS There were 286 hits on MEDLINE, 200 on Web of Science and 476 on Scopus. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, we identified 55 articles in our systematic search. The sample size of the studies varied from 14 to 332 patients with SpA. The reported age range varied from 25 to 56 years in the reviewed studies. The symptom duration of patients with axSpA varied from 1.6 to 49 years. There were more males than females in these studies. Most of the recruited females were premenopausal women. Reported HLA-B27 positivity changed between 19% to 95%. The prevalence of OP and osteopenia in patients with SpA varied from 3%-47% to 5%-88%, respectively, in the included studies. In particular, the prevalence of OP and osteopenia ranged from 2.0%-47.0% and 5.0%-78.3%, respectively, in patients with AS. There are conflicting results regarding the relationship among disease activity, acute phase response and bone mass. Some studies suggest good correlation of bone mass with disease activity and acute phase reactants. CONCLUSION Bone loss may be determined in patients with axSpA at the lumbar spine or proximal femur even in the early phase of the disease and may be associated with inflammation (bone marrow edema) at the vertebral colon.},

	abstract = {One of the challenging issues in modern biomedical science is the increasing number of osteoporosis patients due to the expansion of elderly populations. Among aging-related pathogenic changes, alterations in bone function and skeletal pathogenesis is a particularly important issue of concern. Osteoporosis is one of the most serious bone-related pathogenic states, as it causes serious loss of quality of life. Alterations in estrogen levels in accordance with aging are one of the key risk factors for osteoporosis. Complexed estrogen actions on bones can be traced by analyzing bone mineral components, as those elements accumulate as mineral complexes, reflecting the context of multiple cellular reactions such as bone resorption/osteogenesis. We have analyzed bone trace element composition in ovariectomized (OVX-treated) Cynomolgus monkey models in this study. In order to gain insights into the effects of such defects on bone trace element composition, inductively coupled plasma atomic emissions spectrometry (ICP-AES) analysis was performed. Marked changes in bone trace element levels were found in vertebral bones of OVX-treated Cynomolgus monkeys. An assessment of these trace element spectra in OVX model animals is discussed. These results could provide useful markers for understanding the physiological states of bones in postmenopausal women.},

	doi = {10.1007/s12011-013-9820-7},
	year = {2013},
	abstract = {Progressive bone mineral loss and increasing bone fragility are hallmarks of osteoporosis. A combination of minerals isolated from the red marine algae, Lithothamnion sp. was examined for ability to inhibit bone mineral loss in female mice maintained on either a standard rodent chow (control) diet or a high-fat western diet (HFWD) for 5, 12, and 18 months. At each time point, femora were subjected to μ-CT analysis and biomechanical testing. A subset of caudal vertebrae was also analyzed. Following this, individual elements were assessed in bones. Serum levels of the 5b isoform of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and procollagen type I propeptide (P1NP) were also measured. Trabecular bone loss occurred in both diets (evident as early as 5 months). Cortical bone increased through month 5 and then declined. Cortical bone loss was primarily in mice on the HFWD. Inclusion of the minerals in the diet reduced bone mineral loss in both diets and improved bone strength. Bone mineral density was also enhanced by these minerals. Of several cationic minerals known to be important to bone health, only strontium was significantly increased in bone tissue from animals fed the mineral diets, but the increase was large (5–10 fold). Serum levels of TRAP were consistently higher in mice receiving the minerals, but levels of P1NP were not. These data suggest that trace minerals derived from marine red algae may be used to prevent progressive bone mineral loss in conjunction with calcium. Mineral supplementation could find use as part of an osteoporosis-prevention strategy.},

	title = {Astudy About Some Physiological Parameters In Smokers},
	year = {2017},
	abstract = {Smoking has been accepted as a risk factor for many chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, cancer, ulcers and osteoporosis. Tobacco smoke contains many oxidants and free radicals that can cause damage to lipids, proteins, DNA, carbohydrates and other biomolecules. In vivo, antioxidant nutrients which include vitamin C, selenium (Se), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) play a crucial role in defending against oxidant damage. The present study was designed to investigate the influence of cigarette smoking on serum  Zn, Cu ,PCV,W.B.Cs., and BMI. Eighty healthy men (40 smokers and 40 non-smokers) from Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, volunteered to participate in this study.  Two overnight fasting blood samples were collected from all volunteers. Serum concentrations of trace elements were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The statistical method of t-test and ANOVA was used to identify differences between the cigarette’s smoker and non-smoker group. Mean body mass index (BMI) was different for the smoker and non-smoker group. Mean of PCV for smoker was significantly (p<0.01) higher than those of non-smokers. The mean count of W.B.Cs., was similar for both smokers and non-smokers   The serum zinc levels of smokers were significantly (P<0.05) lower than those of non-smokers. Smokers had significantly no difference in serum copper concentration compared with non-smokers.},

	title = {Pharmaceutical Standardisation of Kukkutanda Tvak Bhasma (Incinerated Egg Shell)},
	year = {2017},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Kukkutand Tvak (eggs shell) is an important drug of Ayurveda and Unani Medicine. In the literature of Rasashastra (branch of Ayurveda chemistry) it is classified under Sudha Varga (group of Calcium containing drugs) and it contains Calcium carbonate up to 90% along with other trace elements like phosphates, magnesium, calcium etc. It is a very cheap source of calcium for human nutrition and many previous research works have proved that Kukkutanda Tvak Bhasma (KTB) minimises the risk of Asthikshay (osteoporosis), Shwetpradar (Leucorrhoea) etc. In classical texts, several number of Bhavana Dravya (levigating material) are advised for the preparation of KTB which enhances its potency. AIM: An attempt has been made to prepare KTB with Bhavana of Asthisamharaka (Cissus quadrangularis Linn) during Marana (incineration). METHODOLOGY: In the present study, Asthisamharka Swaras (juice) as well as Kumari Swaras (Aloe vera juice) is used for the Bhavana Process. Pharmaceutical standardisation was carried out in three batches and parameter for quality assurance was also studied. Analytical study was done to establish the basic standard for KTB. RESULTS: After six alternate Bhavana of Asthisamharka and Kumari Swaras followed with four Putas applying at 850 degree C temperature in Electrical muffle furnace (EMF), After fourth Puta bright white colour, very fine, soft powder, without specific smell obtain Conclusion: Kukkutanda Tvak Bhasma is rich source of calcium was given Bhavana of Asthisamharka and Kumari Swaras to improve its potency. After four Puta it yielded 66.4% Bhasma and 33.6 % weight loss was found. CONCLUSION: As there is no pharmacopeia standard guideline, the analytical findings of present study can be considered for future research and also there is a need to evaluate the efficacy of this formulation as an Asthiposhak (Strength to Asthi Dhatu) in condition of calcium deficiency and osteoporosis.},

Rats, aged 3 months, were ovariectomized and when 6 month intervened with the conditioned, low, moderate, and high teCaP diets.ResultsThe teCaP particles showed highly dissolvable in stomach juice-mimicing acidic solutions. Three months after intervention, the body weight increase showed remarkable differences among the low teCaP diet (∼52 g), moderate teCaP diet (∼34 g) and high teCaP diet (∼23 g) group. In particular, the intake of moderate teCaP greatly improved the retention of trace elements in femural bone for better protection against the skeletal weakening, and resulted in a significant increase of bone mineral density (104.06%) in comparison with the conventional high calcium plus vitamin D3 diet (Control group).ConclusionsThese investigations improve our understanding of micronutrient retention on bone consolidation in osteoporotic bone tissue, and also provide new mild wet-chemical approach to prepare potent nutritionally effective edible complements to synergistically relieve bone degeneration and prevent osteoporosis.},

	title = {COPPER IN THE HUMAN ORGANISM},
	year = {2011},
	abstract = {Copper is an essential micronutrient for human bodies, whose distribution in different organs and tissues, metabolism and physiological impact is not thoroughly explained yet. Further issues which need clarification are the exact composition and constitution of its combinations with other elements, the physiological impact of copper and copper-enzymes in sickness and health. Biomarkers for identification of copper status are still being defined. They are necessary in order to determine the prophylactics and treatment of diseases and conditions, which are related to changes of copper concentrations in human bodies. Researches continue in an attempt to develop analytical methods for determination of copper in serum and urine, which are used in clinical laboratory diagnostics. These current developments justify the purpose of our research: to make a brief review of some issues related to studying the trace element copper. In the present paper, we have reviewed a part of the essential copper enzymes – cytochrome c oxidase, lysyl oxidase, feroxidase, monoamine oxygenase, superoxide dismutase, etc., e.g the physiological functions, which depend on the presence of these essential copper enzymes in the human organism. The issues of copper metabolism and the interactions of copper with other micronutrients (zinc, iron, vitamins A, C, E) are briefly discussed. An overview of the influence of copper on several diseases: Menkes syndrome, Wilson's disease, cardiovascular diseases, oxidative stress, osteoporosis, diabetes, chronic diarrhea, cystic fibrosis, is performed as well. The results from our study in children, aged 1 ÷ 3 years, with anemia, cystic fibrosis and chronic diarrhea and a healthy control group, showed significantly lower levels of copper in blood serum of patients as compared to controls. In conclusion , based on our brief review we might state that the results obtained from different researchers in respect of the influence of copper in different diseases and conditions are conflicting. There is a necessity of accurate and accessible methods for determination of serum copper in research and clinical biomedical laboratories. It is obvious that further research work is needed in order to clarify the contradictions and determine the role of copper in the human organism.},

	year = {2005},
	abstract = {With the human race experiencing a progressive increase in life expectancy, we are facing a growing prevalence of chronic age-related conditions, among which osteoporosis is a generalised condition of bone, whose hallmark is increased bone fragility. Based on the overwhelming body of evidence emphasising that gonadal failure at the time of menopause causes osteopenia and the administration of estrogens in postmenopausal women prevents this loss, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has been widely recommended. However HRT should be limited due to its potential adverse effects. In this light, an effort should be made to integrate alternative therapies of proven values to provide new options for women in midlife. Research in nutrition over the past 30 years has led to exciting and significant progress. Although the primary role of diet is to provide sufficient nutrients to fulfill the metabolic requirements of an individual, there is an emerging rationale to support the hypothesis that, by modulating specific target functions in the body, diet can help to achieve optimal health and also play an important role in reducing the risk of disease. Specifically, it has been recognized that human diet contains, in addition to essential macro- and micronutrients, a complex array of naturally occurring bioactive molecules, the phytochemicals, that may confer significant long-term health benefits. Indeed, besides calcium, micronutrients such as vitamins, polyphenols, phytoestrogens, trace elements or minerals remain a source for putative new and innovative dietary health intervention in the nutritional prevention of osteoporosis.},

	year = {2009},
	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to investigate the correlation between serum macro-element and trace element contents and bone mineral density (BMD) as well as the occurrence of osteoporosis. After the epidemiological investigation of 290 postmenopausal women from ages 45 to 65 in the Xi’an urban area, their blood was collected and serum concentrations of macro-elements, calcium, phosphonium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, and trace elements, zinc, iron, copper, and selenium were determined using atomic absorption spectrometry. Their BMD was measured by QDR-2000 dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The correlation analysis between BMD and serum element contents was done with the software of SPSS 13.0. The correlation analysis of serum elements of postmenopausal women showed that there was a significant correlation between serum calcium and the other elements, and also a significant correlation between serum phosphonium and the others except serum potassium. The serum potassium content had a significant correlation with serum calcium, sodium and iron, but sodium content showed a significant correlation with the others except iron and selenium. In addition, copper had a significant correlation with the others except potassium and selenium. In correlation analysis between BMD and the elements contents, only did the potassium content show a significant positive correlation with BMD of lumbar vertebra and proximal femora. The comparison results between osteoporosis group, osteopenia group, and healthy group showed that there was no significant difference in the element contents between the groups, but there existed a tendency that potassium content increased with the rise of BMD. There exist significant correlations between the contents of serum elements such as calcium, phosphonium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, zinc, iron, copper, and selenium, but no significant differences in these elements contents between the osteoporosis group, osteopenia group, and healthy group. Serum potassium content shows a significant positive correlation with BMD, suggesting potassium may be involved in the development of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.},

Criteria, history and uses of RDAs were summarized along with data on dietary intakes, balance and depletion experiments, low (fats and oils, skim milk and yogurt) and high (legumes, mushrooms, nuts and seeds) copper foods and hazards of zinc supplements. Bone disease and cardiovascular disease from diets-low in copper have been studied in animals for decades. Men and women fed diets close to 1 mg of copper per day, amounts quite frequent in the US, responded similarly to deficient animals with reversible, potentially harmful changes in blood pressure control, cholesterol and glucose metabolism, and electrocardiograms. Women supplemented with trace elements including copper experienced beneficial effects on bone density. These data exceed similar data on magnesium, selenium and zinc and are sufficient for establishing an RDA. Ischemic heart disease and osteoporosis are likely consequences of diets low in copper. Numerous anatomical, chemical and physiological similarities between animals deficient in copper and people with ischemic heart disease have been noticed. Association between osteoporosis and low copper status deserves further inquiry. Augmenting low copper diets with high copper foods may be beneficial. Committees that establish RDAs should return to the traditions of the first nine editions and make recommendations that promote health and nutritional welfare, meet functional needs, prevent disease and promote public welfare.},

	doi = {10.4172/2376-1318.1000137},
	year = {2016},
	abstract = {Purpose: Osteoporosis is a bone metabolic disorder which is well known to increase bone porosity and is the outcome of various factors like ageing, genetic, nutritional deficiency, decreased calcium uptake, and last but the most important hormonal imbalances. Hormonal imbalance is one of the major factors affecting women worldwide and leading to osteoporosis. Trace elements play a very essential role in number of pathological conditions. Ingestion of zinc in the early stages of bone loss may be more beneficial in mitigating bone loss and also in improving the overall strength of the bone. In the current work, we have intended to extract the information pertaining to the mechanical strength of bone, bone tissue composition and hydroxyapatite crystallite size upon supplementing zinc in the osteopenic condition. Methods: Forty eight wistar female rats in two set of twenty four animals each were assigned to four groups: Control, Zinc, Ovariectomized (OVX) and OVX+Zinc. Duration of the treatment period was of eight weeks. Biochemical estimations were carried out to make comparison between the treatment groups based on bone metabolism markers in serum. Bone mechanical strength of both the bones i.e., femur and tibia, was assessed using texture analyzer. Also, bone matrix analysis using Fourier transformer infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction studies were carried out for all the treatment groups. Results: Estradiol levels decreased and tartarate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b levels increased in the OVX group. Zinc supplemented following ovariectomy regulated these levels. The OVX group showed significantly higher serum alkaline phosphatase levels, which recovered upon zinc supplementation. Further, zinc plays a potential role in preventing bone tissue deterioration by restoring its composition and microstructure in the post-menopausal condition, thereby, maintaining the mechanical strength of the bone. Conclusion: These findings suggested that alterations in the bone tissue material properties following estrogen deficiency can be averted by zinc if administered at early stages of bone loss.},

	year = {2015},
	abstract = {Background : The use of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids has been studied in the context of healing and tissue regeneration mainly due to its anti-inflammatory, immunoregulatory and antioncogenic properties. Previous studies have demonstrated beneficial effects with the use of enteral immunonutrition containing various farmaconutrients such as L-arginine, omega-3, trace elements, but the individual action of each component in the healing of colonic anastomosis remains unclear. Aim : To evaluate the influence of preoperative supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids on the healing of colonic anastomoses of well-nourished rats. Methods : Forty Wistar adult male rats, weighing 234.4±22.3 g were used. The animals were divided into two groups: the control group received for seven days olive oil rich in omega-9 oil through an orogastric tube, while the study group received isocaloric and isovolumetric omega-3 emulsion at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day, also for seven days. Both groups were submitted to two colotomies followed by anastomosis, in the right and left colon, respectively. Parameters evaluated included changes in body weight, anastomotic complications and mortality, as well as maximum tensile strength by using a tensiometer and collagen densitometry at the anastomotic site. Results : There were no differences in body weight or mortality and morbidity between groups. The value of the maximum tensile strength of the control group was 1.9±0.3 N and the study group 1.7±0.2, p=0.357. There was, however, a larger amount of type I collagen deposition in the study group (p=0.0126). The collagen maturation índex was 1.74±0.71 in the control group and 1.67±0.5 in the study group; p=0,719). Conclusions : Preoperative supplementation of omega-3 fatty acid in rats is associated with increased collagen deposition of type I fibers in colonic anastomoses on the 5th postoperative day. No differences were observed in the tensile strength or collagen maturation index.},

	year = {2001},
	abstract = {Abstract Adequate provision of nutrients composing the bone matrix and regulating bone metabolism should be provided from birth in order to achieve maximal bone mass, compatible with individual genetic background, and to prevent osteoporosis later in life. Low calcium intake (<250 mg day−1) in children is associated with both a reduced bone mineral content and hyperparathyroidism. Optimal calcium intake is, however, still a matter of controversy. The minimisation of fracture risk would be the ideal functional outcome on which to evaluate lifetime calcium intakes, but proxy indicators, such as bone mass measurements or maximal calcium retention, are used instead. Calcium recommendations in Europe and the United States are based on different concepts as to requirements, leading to somewhat different interpretations of dietary adequacy. Minerals and trace elements other than calcium are involved in skeletal growth, some of them as matrix constituents, such as magnesium and fluoride, others as components of enzymatic systems involved in matrix turnover, such as zinc, copper and manganese. Vitamins also play a role in calcium metabolism (e.g. vitamin D) or as co-factors of key enzymes for skeletal metabolism (e.g. vitamins C and K). Physical activity has different effects on bone depending on its intensity, frequency, duration and the age at which it is started. The anabolic effect on bone is greater in adolescence and as a result of weight-bearing exercise. Adequate intakes of calcium appear necessary for exercise to have its bone stimulating action.},

	abstract = {Background: The effect of oestrogen deficiency after menopause on the trace elements may give rise to some metabolic disturbances leading to osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, arterial hypertension, thyroid disorders and many other pathological conditions. Objective: This study was meant to unravel the possible effects of menopause on some select trace elements. Methodology: A total of 100 subjects were selected for this study which comprised 50 pre-menopausal (control) and 50 post-menopausal (test). The subjects were divided into different age categories and duration. Determination of the concentrations of trace elements was performed using the FS-240 atomic absorption spectrophotometry method. Results: There was a significant decrease in the mean concentrations of zinc and cobalt in the post-menopausal subjects (test), compared with the pre-menopausal group ( p<0.01 ). However, a significant increase was observed in the mean levels of selenium in the post-menopausal group (test), compared with that of the pre-menopausal individuals ( p<0.01 ), while there was no significant difference in the mean concentration of copper in the post-menopausal subjects, compared with the pre-menopausal group ( p=0.428 ). Conclusion: Oestrogen deficiency after menopause may be the cause of some fluctuations in the serum concentrations of trace elements. This work has established that the serum concentrations of zinc and cobalt are diminished with a concomitant increase in selenium in post-menopausal women. The precise impact of this deficiency and possible influence of oestrogen therapy on trace element status in post-menopausal women need further larger-population studies.

	doi = {10.1007/s11695-016-2225-x},
	year = {2016},
	abstract = {Post-operative malnutrition is extremely rare after restrictive surgery (ring, sleeve gastrectomy) although may occur after malabsorbative surgery (bypass, duodenal switch) [1] and is due to the restriction and change in absorption. Philipp Nett et al. concluded that BFrom this standpoint, initial prescription and supplementation of micronutrients and further adjustments during the followup was insufficient to meet the demand of vitamins and minerals in the long-term^ [2]. However, we do not entirely agree with Philipp Nett at al; we agree that the exclusion of the initial part of the small bowel causes malabsorption of minerals, trace elements, lipidand water-soluble vitamins, calcium, magnesium, iron, intrinsic factor, and vitamin B12. Iron and calcium are absorbed in the duodenum explaining the risk of postoperative anaemia following bypass or biliopancreatic shunting and occurs in 20 to 50 % of cases. If the Y loop is long, vitamin D deficiency may occur [3]. The long-term risk is that of osteoporosis and osteomalacia. Cases of secondary hyperparathyroidism after gastric bypass have also been described. Vitamin B12, folate (vit B9), and thiamine (vit B1) deficiency may occur in 26 to 66 % of cases, and for this reason, most patients who have malabsorbative surgery are given multi-vitamin complexes, iron, calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin B12 for life after post-operative malabsorbative surgery [4]. The risk of protein malnutrition is higher in biliopancreatic shunting and is characterised by regaining weight due to lower limb oedema. This is a medical emergency. General surgeons and emergency departments must be aware of the management of these patients. Their complications are rare and the most insidious are deficiencies which may result in irreversible neurological complications. If the least doubt is present, a medical or surgical consultation should be requested with a specialist practitioner in the management of obese patients as death rates increase with delayed diagnosis. Obese patients often suffer from associated nutrient deficiencies, in particular liposoluble vitamins, folate, and zinc. These deficiencies worsen after bariatric surgery and others may appear, especially due to the restriction of food intake from the gastric bypass surgery and malabsorption induced by bypass-type procedures. In 2014 Donal K. et al. published the results of their study relating to 148 patients who underwent Roux-enY bariatric surgery [5]. The most commonly diagnosed post-surgical deficiencies are iron (47–66 %), vitamin B12 (37–50 %), folic acid (15–38 %), vitamin D (20– 51 %), and calcium (10 %) calling for management of the treatment of these deficiencies [6, 7]. However, the recommendations vary and multi-vitamin supplementation specific to bypass surgery is not always available [8, 9]. Literary analysis by the Haute Autorité de Santé (French national authority for health) (Guidelines published in 2009: BObesity: surgical management of adults^) highlighted the lack of data, follow-up and low level of evidence relating to the nutrient and vitamin intake required to prevent and treat deficiencies. Yet all patients face nutrient deficiencies 3 months after bypass-type bariatric surgery. The management recommended by the Haute Autorité de Santé includes monitoring the parameters set out in this study.

	title = {A Review of the Uses of Poultry Eggshells and Shell Membranes},
	year = {2011},
	abstract = {This study was conducted to find out the multiple uses of eggshells in nutrition and medicine. Eggshells can be utilized for various purposes that minimize their effect on environmental pollution. Eggshells present healthy, balanced calcium due to its trace amounts of other minerals and is probably the best natural source of calcium. One whole medium sized eggshell makes about one teaspoon of powder, which yields about 750-800 mgs of elemental calcium plus other micro elements. Eggshell powder has been reported to increase bone mineral density in people and animals with osteoporosis. In laying hens in the late production phase, eggshell powder has been found to increase egg production and improve the quality of shells. Discarded eggshells are often used as a plant fertilizer and are effective liming sources. This is because eggshells contain calcium that raises, or neutralizes, the pH level of overly acidic soil. Chicken eggshells can be used as an alternative soil stabilizer like lime since they have the same chemical composition. Such stabilized soil can be used as subgrade materials in road construction works. Eggshell membrane consists of collagen as a component. Collagen is a type of protein, fibrous in nature that connects and supports other bodily tissues, such as skin, bone, tendons, muscles and cartilage. Collagen has been isolated mainly from bovine and swine skins and bones Collagen used in medicine, biochemical, pharmaceutical, food and cosmetics industries. After the outbreaks of bovine spongioform encephalopathy, foot and mouth disease, autoimmune and allergic reactions, restrictions on collagen uses from these sources were enforced. Eggshell membrane collagen is very low in autoimmune and allergic reactions as well as high in bio-safety and is of similar characteristics to other mammalian collagen. Eggshells/shell membranes have multiple uses in nutrition, medicine, construction and art works.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by low bone mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue. Understanding the effect of mineral supplementation on bone growth may lead to the development of treatments for bone deteriorating diseases. Trace Minerals® Essential Elements (Entrenet Nutritionals, Cuddy, PA) is a holistic supplement designed to improve mineral balance and deficiency in humans. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of in ovo mineral supplementation with or without calcium on bone growth, bending strength, and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) and histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) gene expression during chicken development. Treatment groups consisted of a saline control (S), Essential Elements (E), and Essential Elements plus calcium (C) injected on the 6th day of embryonic development. Growth parameters and whole embryo samples were collected on the 18th day of incubation. Measurements of various morphological features showed no significant difference between the three treatments. The bone strength of the E group was numerically lower when compared to the control whereas the C group had numerically higher bone strength values than the control. Gene expression of CNP was significantly (P=0.0021) higher in the C group compared to the S group, whereas HDAC4 was not found to be significantly different between the treatments. Overall, proper mineral balance is essential for optimum bone growth and development; modifications in mineral intake balance can present as enhanced bone mineral density, accelerated bone growth, or hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.},

	abstract = {The following personal viewpoint is a retrospective from diverse histological and elemental microanalytical techniques applied to mineralogenesis that repeatedly suggested a similarity of the inorganic phase of bone to indigenous populations of microbe-like objects (0.1 -1.0 µm) calcified with phosphate. There is evidence that the microspherical particles are fabricated in the “young” osteocyte golgi apparatus by a process common to unicellular organisms. Inside pre-programmed golgi saccules the “nascent” mineral is contained and controlled by envelopes of specific proteins and lipids in an advancement over a rudimentary version found in calcifying prokaryotes. An intracellular bio-inorganic interface (silicon, calcium and phosphate-rich) is central, primed by carbonate and tempered by trace elements (Mg, Al, Fe). To a lesser extent soft tissues also perform this inherent golgi-directed activity (with potential clinical aberrations). With age the organelle produces calcified microspheres that may be too large (osteoarthritis) or too small (osteoporosis), while “switching off” to allow hard tissues to weaken and “switching on” making soft ones stiffen. Historically the bony biospheres may return to sedimentary rocks to be mined as fertiliser, fuelling an ancient cycle driven by distant golgi bodies with a cargo of bone salt resembling vestigial prokaryotes and primordial “pre-prokaryotes”.},

	abstract = {Boron (B) and molybdenum (Mo), two of the seven essential micronutrients, also known as trace elements, are required for the normal growth of most plants. The Principal functions of B include its role in membrane integrity, seed production, root elongation and sugar metabolism. During recent years, B has also been found to be implicated in human health. Detailed studies need to be undertaken to monitor and promote the concentration of B in vegetables and other food crops as it may be related to human and animal health. The chief biochemical functions of Mo include its role in N fixation in legumes, and regulation of nitrate reduction and protein content. The role of Mo in humans, in general, is less well understood. Plants can have very high levels of Mo before its toxicity symptoms appear. It is well known that feeding crops, high in Mo, to the cattle, results in Mo toxicity, often referred to as molybdenosis or Mo induced Cu deficiency. In humans, B deficiency has been found to be linked to calcium metabolism, bone health, prostate cancer, enhancing the effect of estrogen ingestion, cognitive functions, thyroids function and some other ailments. Some of the B deficiency diseases include arthritis, osteoporosis and abnormal bone growth, reduced estrogen ingestion, rapid heart rate and muscle cramping. In general, Mo deficiency in humans is not common. Deficiency of Mo in humans has been reported in patients receiving prolonged parenteral nutrition. Chief symptoms of Mo deficiency include tachycardia, headache, mental disturbances and coma.},

	doi = {10.5601/jelem.2011.16.3.13},
	year = {2011},
	abstract = {Trace elements are a very important factor affecting functions of living organisms. Silicon, the third most abundant trace element in the human body, is present in all healthy tissues of people. It is especially strongly associated with connective tissues, as it has been found to participate in bone development, collagen formation and mineralization of bone matrix. Silicon has also been suggested to be involved in mammalian hormonal control and to protect people from heart diseases. An average dietary intake of silicon is about 20-30 mg/person/day, with higher intakes for men than women. Silicic acid or orthosilicic acid are the bioavailable forms of silicon, found mainly in food rich in fibre and whole grains, in vegetables, fruit and in drinking water. Various alcoholic beverages such as beer or wine also contain considerable amounts of silicon. Silicon provided with food is digested in the gastrointestinal tract to silicic acid, which is then absorbed. With blood, it is distributed into various tissues and organs, where it can exerts its action. The highest amounts of silicon are accumulated in the kidneys, liver, bone, skin, spleen, lungs, while free orthosilicic acid, not bounded to proteins, occurs in blood. The amount of silicon in tissues decreases with age. Depleted levels of silicon have also been observed in some pathological states e.g. atherosclerosis. The aim of the paper has been to present the role of dietary silicon in living organisms. Silicon is necessary for the growth and bone calcification and as a biological crosslinking agent of connective-tissue-based membrane structures. This element is considered to have beneficial effects on several human disorders, including osteoporosis, ageing of skin, hair and nails or atherosclerosis. It has also been suggested that silicon and silicic acid may decrease the bioavailability of aluminium by blocking the uptake of the latter by the gastrointestinal tract and impeding its reabsorption in the kidneys, thus protecting an organism against the toxic (especially neurotoxic) action of aluminium. Anticancer, antiatherosclerotic and antidiabetic effects of silicon have also been suggested.},

	title = {Quantitative assessment of silicon in fresh and processed bamboo shoots and its potential as functional element in food , nutraceuticals and cosmeceuticals},
	year = {2018},
	abstract = {Bamboo, belonging to the family Poaceae, is considered a valuable plant due to its numerous industrial and medicinal uses and is also known to be a distinctive silicon accumulator. Silicon has not been largely documented as an essential trace element but over the past few decades, several biochemical and clinical studies have demonstrated the advantageous effects of silicon on the human health. Though biological attention in this element has increased, data of silicon content in majority of the food plants still need to be determined. In this study, silicon content was estimated by Wavelength Dispersive X-Ray Florescence (WDXRF) spectrometer technique in the fresh and processed (soaked, boiled, fermented) shoots at different storage stages (3 – 12 months) at 4oC of five bamboo species viz. Bambusa balcooa, Dendrocalamus giganteus, D. hamiltonii, D. membranaceus and Phyllostachys mannii that are grown in different geographical regions of India. Results revealed the highest silicon content was found in D. hamiltonii (190 mg/100g d.w.) and least in P. mannii (70 mg/100g d.w.). Silicon content was reduced by 6-33% with all processing except soaking in D. giganteus and P. mannii and by 25-71% after 3-12 months storage. The highest amount of Si was retained in shoots of D. giganteus after processing and storage. Bamboo shoots were also found to be silicon-rich food that can offer significant prospects for Si dietary supplementation. Moreover, the abundance of silicon in bamboo shoots can be promising to be used as food supplement as well as for nutraceutical and cosmetic industries. Introduction The role of minerals in medicine is gradually becoming more prominent nowadays. Trace elements are presently being studied to define their dietary significance and influence on health. For a long time, silicon (Si) was not largely documented as an essential trace element and believed to be an inactive material. The majority of people recognize silicon and its compounds as a class of substance used in manufacture of glass and electronic devices, such as transistors, solar cells, rectifiers and microchips as well as an ingredient in soaps, adhesives, lubricants, polishing agents and medical implants (Kanda 1991; Jugdaohsingh 2007; Price et al. 2013). However, over the past few decades several biochemical and clinical studies have demonstrated the advantageous effects of silicon and documented it as one of the most indispensable trace element in human metabolism (Martin 2013; Cofrades et al. 2016; Arora and Arora 2017). Silicon bound to glycosaminoglycan is a significant constituent of the extracellular matrix and also stimulates the crosslinking and synthesis of protein such as elastin and collagen that gives the strength, integrity and flexibility to the connective tissues of skin, bones, nails, hairs and arteries (Martin 2013). It is also considered as an anti-aging nutrient and also responsible for maintaining bone volume and density in osteoporosis patients (Jugdaohsingh 2007). Silicon is in consideration for promotion to the rank of a “plant beneficial substance” by the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials (AAPFCO 2006). Silicon (Si) is a chemical element, tetravalent metalloid with an atomic number of 14 and atomic weight of 28. It is semiconductor and its crystalline form is piezo resistive, thus extensively used in micro pressure transducers and computer electronics. Silicon is the second most plentiful element after oxygen in the Earth's crust (Exley 1998). In nature, it is rarely present in elemental form as it bonds strongly with oxygen and forms insoluble silica (SiO2) and silicates compounds. These are highly stable structures and have several industrial applications comprising electronics, abrasives and construction. These silica compounds have poor water solubility and biological availability and thus are not useful dietary sources (Peters et al. 1999; Martin 2013; Price et al. 2013). On the contrary, chemical and biological weathering releases and dissolves silicon in water from geological formations and results in formation of several water soluble forms denoted together as silicic acid (ortho‐, meta‐, di‐, and tri‐silicates) that are more biologically available (Price et al. 2013). Silicon in plants Silicon is extensively present in its inorganic form SiO2 in the soil which can be absorbed by plants and transform inorganic silica into organic form i.e. orthosilicic or monosilicic acid Si(OH)4, which is taken up by the plant roots through transpiration stream and making it bioavailable for humans to absorb (Epstein 1999, Jugdaohsingh et al. 2002; Li et al. 2014). In plants, silica gets bonded with water molecules and is usually deposited in microscopic bodies named as phytoliths or opal phytolith which is present in the the cell wall, lumen and intercellular space during plant growth (Kaufman et al. 1999; Tripathi et al. 2012). These phytoliths are present in several plants, particularly abundant in members of family poaceae, e.g., bamboo, rice (Li et al. 2014; Tripathi et al. 2017). Silicon improves plant cell wall strength and structural integrity, plant vigour, biomass, yield and plants resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses (Epstein 1999; Tripathi et al. 2017). The plant-based products have more silicon than animal based products (Pennington 1991), common plant based foods with high silicon content are cereals (rice, barley, oats) and some vegetables (beans, spinach and root vegetables (Jugadohsingh 2007). Though biological attention in this element has increased, data of silicon content in majority of the food plants still need to be determined. Bamboo, a distinctive phytolith-accumulator belongs to family Poaceae, is predominantly distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of the world (Li et al. 2014). Bamboo is the richest known source of natural silica, containing over 70% organic silica, which is more than ten times the level found in the widely used horsetail plant (Equisetum) (5% to 7% silica). Different parts of bamboos are used in ancient Chinese, Indian Ayurveda, Tibetan and various traditional system of medicine for a number of ailments (Nirmala and Bisht 2017). Tabasheer or banslochan or bamboo-manna, mainly consist of pure silica, obtained from bamboo internodes is a part of the pharmacology of the traditional Ayurvedic and Unani medicine in the Indian subcontinent. It acts as stimulant, astringent, febrifuge, tonic with antispasmodic and aphrodisiac properties and main ingredient in Sitopaladi Ayurveda medicine (Nirmala and Bisht 2017). Menghao et al (2012) investigated the effect of silica extract of Phyllostachys edulis leaves on bone loss in ovariectomized rats and observed that silica supplementation increased significantly the femoral and lumbar bone mass density. Bamboo shoots, the young edible buds of bamboo, are gaining ample cognizance globally due to occurrence of various nutrients and active phytochemicals which are proven to have biological activities (Bajwa et al. 2016; Rawat et al. 2016; Nirmala and Bisht 2017). Fresh shoots are the most delicious and nutritious part of the bamboo. However, consumers preferred shoots in pickled, fermented, canned, roasted, boiled and salted forms. It is also widely incorporated in numerous indigenous and contemporary dishes in different parts of the world (Rawat et al. 2016). Analysis of some macro and micromineral elements has been worked out in some bamboo genera; Bambusa, Chimonabamusa, Dendrocalamus, Pseudosasa and Phyllostachys (Waikhom et al. 2013; Christian et al. 2015; Park and Jhon 2013; Saini et al. 2017). Bamboos are remarkably good silica accumulators but silicon content found in fresh and processed shoots of different bamboo species are not very well known. In this study, an advanced technique the wavelength dispersion X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (WDXRF) was used for quantitative assessment of silicon of fresh and processed shoots of five bamboo species growing in Indian subcontinent. Material and methods Sample collection Young shoots of five bamboo species viz. Bambusa balcooa Roxb, Dendrocalamus giganteus Munro, Dendrocalamus hamiltonii Nees \& Arn. Ex Munro, Dendrocalamus membranaceus Munro and Phyllostachys mannii Gamble were analyzed. The shoots of selected species were harvested during the months of May to September for three consecutive years (2014-2016) from upper Shillong, Meghalaya (25.5o N, 91.89o E); Imphal, Manipur (24.66° N, 93.9° E); Forest Research Institute, Dehradun, Uttarakhand (30.3° N, 78.0° E) and Bambusetum of P.N. Mehra Botanical garden, Chandigarh (30.5° N, 76.5° E). In laboratory, the hard outer culm sheaths of harvested shoots were removed or peeled off by hand or knife and the inedible hard basal portion of shoot was discarded while the remaining edible part was washed and cleaned under tap water. Processing of samples Processing methods used in current analysis were boiling, soaking, fermentation, storage in water and brine for three, six and twelve months. Boiling and soaking: 200g of shoot samples were cut into cubes and boiled for 20 minutes and soaked for 12 hours in water. The duration of treatments were selected as a result of preliminary works (Rawat et al. 2016). Fermentation: 200g of shoots were chopped into thin slices and then squeezed compactly in clean muslin cloth. These were then put into small jars and kept under pressure by putting weight above samples and left for 15-25 days at room temperature 25 ± 2°C. Shoots were hand pressed at regular intervals for removal of exudates coming out from the shoots during the process. The particular aroma and softness of shoot tissue confirmed the completion of fermentation. Refrigerated storage: 400g of shoots were boiled and packaged in autoclaved glass bottles with presterilized water and 5% brine (w/v). The containers were then covered tightly and stored up to twelve months in refrigerator at 4°C. Quantitative analysis},

Bone trace elements analysis have shown high bone S(r), Mg and Mn, and low Fe, Zn and Cu in those skeletons with a more reduced TBM.

	title = {Age-Related Changes in Serum Calcium and Phosphorus Levels in Osteopenic and Osteoporotic Urban Women},
	year = {2014},
	abstract = {The calcium and phosphorus play a crucial role in the bone health status of an individual. The quantitative ultra sound (QUS) bone densitometry measured at calcaneous bone is used to evaluate the bone strength based on WHO criteria of BMD T-score standard deviation against normal adult mean. Accordingly the women are divided into normal, osteopenic and osteoporotic women. The age-related changes are evaluated by four different age groups viz., 35-44, 45-54, 55-64 and 65-74 years. The results clearly indicated by reduction in serum calcium and phosphorus with progressive age and as the bone health regressed from normal to osteopenia and to osteoporosis. Intervention strategies in dietary modifications by including calcium rich foods might reduce the extent of bone loss and consequences of osteoporotic risk levels in aged and elderly women. Introduction The key to bone health lies in the body’s calcium balance. Calcium plays a vital role in intracellular communications and other body processes which require regulation of the calcium in serum within narrow limits. The skeleton serves as a bank from which the blood can borrow and return calcium as needed. If the ‘saving account’ is not sufficient, then it will develop the fragile bones of osteoporosis. Maintaining serum calcium level through sufficient dietary intake could prevent or at least would slow down the consequence of bone loss associated with ageing process. [1] Calcium requirements for skeleton maintenance fluctuate throughout a women’s life. During the teen years, calcium requirements are high because of the demands of a rapidly growing skeleton. Low calcium intake during that time may impede reaching peak bone mass, which can increase the risk of osteoporosis later in life. During woman’s 20s, less calcium is required as bone turnover stabilizes (i.e., bone formation and resorption rates become balanced) and peak adult bone mass is achieved. Calcium requirements remain stable until menopause. When woman reaches menopause, the bone resorption rate increases, bone mass declines and associated with the fall in ovarian estrogen production. Calcium needs rise at that time because of a decrease in the efficiency of utilization of dietary calcium, which is also associated with the fall in ovarian estrogen production. [2] While calcium is the most prevalent element in bone, bone diseases (such as osteoporosis) are due to more than just a lack of calcium. Several other nutrients and minerals, including phosphorus are also critical for maintaining healthy bones. Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for human and animal life. It is fundamental to growth, maintenance, and repair of all body tissues, and is necessary, along with calcium and magnesium for proper growth and formation of bones in infants and children. Sufficient phosphorus intake is important throughout life to ensure the proper balance of essential minerals in order to promote re-mineralization of bones and teeth to keep them in a healthy state. [3] Since these two are concerned with calcification of bone, they are often determined together. In addition to the part which it plays in the building of bones and teeth, the calcium present in the blood and other extracellular fluid is important for maintaining the correct conditions for normal nerve irritability and muscle contraction and plays a role in blood coagulation. Phosphorus is more widely distributed than calcium. Besides being present in bones and teeth, unlike calcium it is found in the cells and so is present in the soft tissues and in many important substances like nucleic acids, coenzymes etc and essential for acid-base regulation. Based on the need of the dual elements, calcium and phosphorus in the maintenance of appropriate bone health and bodily functions throughout human life, the current research is aimed at the estimation of serum calcium and phosphorus levels among urban women in relation to bone metabolic conditions, osteopenia and osteoporosis. Methodology The age-related changes are evaluated among urban women through assessment of alterations in serum calcium and phosphorus levels in relation to bone metabolic conditions of osteopenia and osteoporosis among four different age groups viz., younger (35-44 years), middle aged (45-54 years), aged (55-64 years) and elderly (65-74 years) women. The whole urban women study group comprised of 260 members with sub-sample sizes of 60 in younger, 80 in middle aged, 80 in aged and 40 in elderly aged women respectively. The osteoporotic condition is analyzed based on BMD T-score obtained from QUS bone densitometry. WHO classification of BMD T-score is followed to categorize the women into normal (BMD T-Score: >-1.0), Osteopenia (BMD T-Score:-1.0 to -2.5) and osteoporosis (<-2.5).

However, in comparison to normal women of the four age groups, osteoporotic women had significantly low values (P < 0.01).

	abstract = {In the past, celiac disease (CD), or intolerance to gluten, was considered a rare disease of infancy characterized by chronic diarrhea with malabsorption and delayed growth. Besides the overt enteropathy, there are other clinic and subclinical forms which appear later in life. Target organs are not limited to the gut, but include liver, thyroid, skin and female and male reproductive systems. CD interference on reproduction is related to the multifactorial nature of the disease, whose pathological manifestations can be modulated, besides gluten, by different concurrent genetic and environmental factors. CD induces malabsorption with consequent deficiencies of micronutrients such as iron, folic acid and vitamin K, which are essential for organogenesis, and fat-soluble vitamins important for spermatogenesis. Regarding endocrine disorders, the deficiencies of specific trace elements on ovarian function could explain its involvement in the increased risk of female osteoporosis in CD patients. Affected males show a picture of tissue resistance to androgens; the increases of follicle-stimulating hormone and prolactin, not associated with infertility, may indicate an imbalance at hypothalamus-pituitary level, with general effects on health. Since reproductive alterations are reversible, adoption of a gluten-free diet supported by early diagnosis is important. Therefore, the detection of early biomarkers, such as deficiencies of vitamins and/or iron and andrological or endocrinological dysfunctions, should trigger timely strategies for prevention and treatment.},

	abstract = {SummaryObjective: Several studies have suggested a compromised bone mass in phenylketonuria patients but most reported on heterogeneous or small patient groups. Our aim was to evaluate peak bone mass in adult PKU patients and to relate BMD to nutritional parameters. Patients and methods: BMD was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in 31 adult PKU patients (18 female), mean age 25 ± 5.3 years. Nutritional intake was calculated based on food diaries. Diet adherence was determined based on patients’ report. Results: Mean blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentration was 968 ± 526 μmol/L (16 ± 8.7 mg/dl). Eight patients (32.2%) met the recommended blood Phe concentration of <726 μmol/L (<12 mg/dl), and there was no significant difference in Phe concentrations between diet-adherent and non-adherent patients. Osteopenia was detected in 11 patients (38.7%), while osteoporosis was detected in 2 patients (6.5%). No correlation was found between BMD and age, blood minerals, Phe, vitamin D and alkaline phosphatase levels, calcium and protein intake, body mass index, and body fat percentage. Conclusions: Peak bone mass is decreased in PKU patients. Possible explanations include long-standing dietary deficiency in protein, calcium, vitamin D or trace elements, or a primary defect in bone turnover inherent to the disease itself. Our data do not favour any of these hypotheses. Further studies are needed to elucidate the cause of low bone density in PKU patients.},

	doi = {10.2174/1874841401003010036},
	year = {2010},
	abstract = {For over twenty years boron has been of interest to investigators confirming the safety and essentiality of the element in humans. Fruits, vegetables, nuts, and pulses are natural sources of boron in the diet which world wide averages about 1-3 mg daily for most adults. In boron-rich regions of Turkey drinking water sources with 29 mg boron/liter are consumed without harmful effects. The European Union established a safe drinking water standard of 1.0 mg boron/ litre a level difficult for some regions to achieve. Safe standards are difficult to establish due to limited information and widely varying boron concentrations in food and water, high exposures in boron-rich regions or occupational settings and voluntary intakes, for example, of boron containing products. Current research implicates boron as an essential nutrient in humans demonstrating healthful effects in cellular functions associated with osteoporosis, arthritis, inflammation and cancer. Proposed mechanisms of action implicate that boron, found in cells as boric acid, participates in important membrane functions and intracellular signaling cascades. Traditionally, biochemical mechanisms associated with health- fully beneficial effects are needed for nutrients to meet the criteria for essentiality in humans. While boron meets the traditional criteria to be determined essential in humans the research process has provided additional insight into essential- ity for boron insight that essentiality for trace elements may based on different criteria. The study of boron in living systems provides a more fundamentally important role by demonstrating functions for trace elements differing from those needed to confirm essentiality previously for carbon based compounds, i.e., carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and vitamins in human nutrition. To conclude, boron can be a model element to introduce a new field of study, "elementomics". Further studies from boron-rich areas are needed to determine essentiality, dietary requirements, metabolic functions, therapeutic applications, economic benefits and important public policies for boron, a biologically important trace element.},

	abstract = {Psammotherapy is a practice that uses sand-baths for therapeutic purposes. Sand-baths in the biogenic carbonate sand from Porto Santo Island, in the archipelago of Madeira, constitutes a good example of the positive interaction of minerals on human health. Recent studies provided much information on relevant physical and chemical properties that could explain this sand�s 200-year-long use, although on a much empirical manner, for the treatment of muscular-skeletal (rheumatic and orthopedic) diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout, osteoporosis, and fibromyalgia. The biogenic carbonate sand from Porto Santo Island consists mainly of bioclasts of calcareous red algae (Rhodophyta), sand-bathing traditionally taking place in the dry sand of the transition zone beach/frontal dune, along the southern coast of the island. Analysis of chemical data shows that Ca, Mg and Sr are the major elements of the biogenic carbonate sand from Porto Santo, elements which are bio-essential for human health. P, S, Si, Al, I, Br, F, B, V, Zn, Cu, Fe, and Se were the minor/trace elements identified in the same sand. The average grain size of this biogenic carbonate sand is estimated at 0.200mm, all sand grain sizes ranging between 0.063mm and 0.500mm. Also, the shape of sand grains is mainly tabular or platy, an essential characteristic for a good adhesion to human skin. In order to be therapeutically effective, sand-bathing in the biogenic carbonate sand from Porto Santo requires sand temperature to be slightly higher (40-42oC) than body temperature (37oC), so as to promote body sweating, an essential condition for the interaction sand/human body. The dermal absorption of the bio-essential elements liberated from sand dissolution is responsible for the healing properties of sand-bathing.},

	title = {The use of energy crops on metal contaminated sandy soils},
	year = {2011},
	abstract = {In the 19th and 20th century (up to 1970s), historic atmospheric deposition of trace metals from metal refinery activities has resulted in elevated concentrations in agricultural soils in the Campine region. As a consequence, a surface area of at least 700 km2 is now contaminated with several toxic metals, including cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb). Previous studies also reported health problems in the vicinity of the smelters with increased risks for renal dysfunction, osteoporosis, lung cancer as well as other health-related issues due to a higher exposure of Cd. Furthermore, the soils in the region are characterised by a sandy texture and relatively low pH, which entails an enhanced risk for uptake of these metals in crops or leaching to the groundwater. Conventional soil remediation approaches tend to be overly expensive considering the moderate levels of pollution and extended areas that need a treatment. Phytoremediation involves the use of plants and their associated microorganisms for the stabilisation, degradation and/or removal of pollutants from the environment. Phytoextraction in particular aims at accumulating elements into the harvestable plant parts so that the contamination can gradually be removed through harvest. The purpose of this research is to assess the feasibility of non-food crops not only as a phytoremediation option, but also forming a risk based management approach for metal contaminated agricultural soil. In this study three non-food crops were evaluated: rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) for plant oil production (biodiesel), willow (Salix) under short rotation coppice and energy maize (Zea mays L.) for biogas production by anaerobic digestion. Rapeseed reached a total shoot biomass of 5.8±2.0 ton DM ha-1 which is in compliance with expected values. However, the seed yield was very low (0.5±0.3 ton DM ha-1). Other reports, with experiments performed in the same year and region but sown on non-contaminated soils and under optimal fertilisation, showed a seed production of 3 ton DM ha-1. The low biomass productivity was attributed to suboptimal fertilisation mainly of nitrogen and sulphur. Observations from the field experiment suggested that 27±14 g Cd ha-1 and 2.0±1.0 kg Zn ha-1 could be removed from the soil by harvesting rapeseed. This means that more than 250 growing cycles of rapeseed would be needed to reduce total Cd concentrations in the top soil layer from 5.0 to 2.9 mg Cd kg-1 (resp. the current concentration in the field plot and the site-specific threshold value of Cd for remediation of the field plot). During subsequent experiments, the growth of rapeseed failed completely. The fact that rapeseed needs to be cultivated in a rotation scheme in order to avoid possible crop failures, also contributes to lower suitability of this crop as an appropriate alternative cropping system for metal contaminated agricultural soils in the Campine region. Secondly, the cultivation of short rotation coppice (SRC) was investigated. Short rotation coppice consists of densely planted, high-yielding varieties of either willow or poplar (Populus), which are harvested every two to five years. After each harvest, new shoots spontaneously re-sprout. From the biomass productivity during the first four years of growth, it could be concluded that a rotation period of four years was needed to reach maximum annual growth potential of all clones. There were strong differences observed in biomass production between clones. After four years, Zwarte Driebast had the highest biomass (~12 ton DM ha-1 year-1), followed by Loden. In contrast, Inger achieved only a biomass production of 1.5 ton DM ha-1 year-1. The metal extraction potential of willow was much higher than that found for rapeseed. The woody biomass itself was in general 72 g Cd and 2.0 kg Zn ha-1 year-1. This means that in order to reduce the concentration of Cd from 6.5 mg kg-1 (current concentration in the field plot) to 3.0±0.3 mg Cd kg-1 (site-specific threshold value of Cd for remediation of the field plot), more than 170 years will be needed. Under normal conditions SRC is harvested in winter, but as the leaves contain high amount of metals, leaf harvest could increase the extraction potential by 40%. Previous reports showed that SRC from contaminated soils can be treated safely, yet it was not further assessed in the current study. Currently, the price of the wood does not guarantee a sufficient income for farmers, compaired to their current farmer income, to make it a suitable alternative cultivation. Neverthelles when the use of wood as energy source becomes more pronounced, wood prices will very likely also stimulate the adoption of SRC in the region. A final investigated option was the use of energy maize. Under optimal fertilisation, energy maize showed an average yield of 53±10 ton FM or 20±3 ton DM ha-1 year-1. The observed productivity levels were similar to those of the same cultivars grown elsewhere in Flanders on non-contaminated sites. As maize is a metal excluder, it contains low concentrations of metals in the different plant compartments. Due to the low concentration of metals in the plant, the extraction potential of energy maize was the lowest of the investigated crops (19±6 g Cd and 4.3±0.9 kg Zn ha-1 year-1), implying that for remediation of the experimental site (from 5.0 to 2.5 mg Cd kg-1) more than 500 years would be needed under optimistic conditions. Lab scale batch results of 14 days, performed at OWS (Organic Waste Systems, Ghent), revealed a biogas production potential of 215±23 Nm3 ton-1 FM which was similar to that of energy maize grown on a non-contaminated soil (194±4 Nm3 ton-1 FM) tested under the same conditions. For obtaining optimal biogas yields, harvest must take place when the plant reaches optimal dry matter content. Although the harvest period optimises the digestibility of the biomass, it does not affect the metal extraction rates significantly. When a semicontinuous digester is fed over a period of 435 days with maize from a contaminated site, similar biogas production levels were achieved. During this semi-continuous test, concentrations of elements in the digestate were on average 3-4 times higher than those in the input material. This is similar to concentration factors observed using energy maize from a non-contaminated site. The quality and characteristics of the digestate can be estimated and evaluated in the context of legal threshold values and limitations for usage. Economic studies indicated that the average annual income of the farmers can be maintained when they convert land use from fodder maize to energy maize. None of the tested energy crops would allow an effective short term (e.g. 20 - 30 years) removal of metals from the soils. However, the presence of contamination is not expected to introduce technical constraints in converting biomass with elevated concentrations into energy. The fate of the metals during subsequent processing of the biomass can be controlled, and eventual constraints in subsequent use and treatment of the secondary products can be managed. If economic viability of energy crop production can be ascertained, it can allow for a long term safe alternative use of the contaminated agricultural land. For energy maize as a cropping alternative, this was found to be the case. Growing energy crops aims at riskreduction, and generates an alternative income for farmers, yet in the long run also generating a gradual reduction of the pollution levels. In this way, remediation is reduced to a secondary objective with sustainable risk-based land use as primary objective. This context has been adopted as ‘phytoattenuation’, setting it apart from ‘conventional’ phytoextraction.},

	abstract = {Fluoride, the ionic form of fluorine, is a natural component of the biosphere and 13th most abundant element in the crust of the earth. It is, therefore, found in a wide range of concentrations in virtually all inanimate and living things. Many trace elements perform a definite function in human metabolism and the question of the value of fluoride, always found in the body, has been raised. Much evidence suggesting that the inclusion of fluoride in drinking water has beneficial as well as adverse effects on human health was obtained. Either alone or in combination with calcium and/or vitamin D, it is used in high daily doses for the treatment of osteoporosis. Although organic fluorine compounds are used in medicine and commerce, the inorganic fluorine compounds are of greater importance toxicologically because they are more readily available. The major pathway of fluoride elimination from the human body is via the kidney. When renal function deteriorates, the ability to excrete fluoride markedly decreases, possibly resulting in greater retention of fluoride in the body. At this point, more research is needed to evaluate the effects of physiological variables on the fluoride metabolism in humans.},

	doi = {10.1118/1.2962735},
	year = {2008},
	abstract = {Purpose: To test the RTP‐Filter, an in‐house independent phantom dose calculation system for IMRT QA. Method and Materials: The dose from all IMRT beams delivered in treatment position was calculated in coronal planes where actual film densitometry for 100 cases was performed in solid water phantoms. A ray trace through the phantom determines the depth and location of points relative to an MLC shape, whose leaf pairs define integration elements for TPR, head scatter and phantom scatter. A virtual scatter source determines the head scatter. Factors for the off‐axis ratio, penumbra, and out‐of‐field scatter and leakage are applied. The calculations were compared with the pinnacle planned dose to create 3%‐3mm and 5%‐5mm decision maps. The same analysis was performed for the original film measurements. Eight physicists scored 200 cases as pass, conditional, or fail, resulting in 1600 scores. Cases exceeding tolerances but that might be clinically acceptable were conditional. Results: Excellent agreement between pinnacle convolution calculations and the RTP‐Filter was obtained, with 89.4% passing, 10.2% conditional, and 0.4% failing. The respective values for the film‐to‐pinnacle comparisons were 67.1%, 26.3%, and 6.6%. Both the film and the RTP‐Filter had the best plan agreement for prostate cases and the least agreement for brain cases. While the trends for error identification were the same (e.g., presence of many small fields), the RTP‐Filter represented more closely the historical decisions that were made, with errors in film densitometry and MLC mis‐calibration identified as the causes for out‐of‐tolerance deviations. The good results of the RTP‐Filter are most likely due to careful modeling of the out‐of‐field and penumbra components. Conclusion: The RTP‐Filter provides fast and robust IMRT QA, decoupling the plan and machine QA. The rate of plan disagreement is lower than that for film due to the absence of film and MLC errors.},

	abstract = {By grinding mixtures of DCPD + CaO + SrO in a planetary ball mill, mixe d calciumstrontium phosphates or hydroxyapatites were mechanochemically s ynthe ized. Calcium and strontium-to-phosphate molar ratios [(Ca+Sr)/P] 1.50, 1.60 and 1.67 were test ed and the relative amount of Sr and Ca was also varied. The kinetic study of the mech ano emical reaction was carried out for all the mixtures by XRD and DSC. The reaction r ate was slightly lower with SrO than with CaO. XRD patterns of the powders after grinding showed an ap titic profile and after heating at 950°C for 2 h, powders were mixed Ca-Sr-hydroxyapatites or tri(Ca/Sr) phosphate or a mixture of them. Introduction Trace elements are an interesting alternative to growth fac ors in order to favor bone formation. Strontium is an element which plays a considerable part in osseous m ineralization and its use is envisaged in osteoporosis treatment [1]. In this goal, some attempt s were already done for introducing strontium in bioceramics [2] to enhance bone ingrowth. We show ed that dry mechanosynthesis was a possible route to obtain calcium deficient hy droxyapatites (CDHAs) that can be used to prepare biphasic calcium phosphate ceramics [3] with the expected calcium-tophosphate ratio Ca/P ± 0.01. CDAHs were prepared by grinding dicalc ium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) and calcium oxide mixtures. Given the similar chemical properties of CaO and SrO, we synthesized strontium-containing HAs or DHAs by replacing partly or completely CaO by SrO according to Eq. 1 with 0 ≤ x ≤ 4, 0 ≤ y ≤ 4 and 3 ≤ x + y ≤ 4. 6 CaHPO4·2H2O + x CaO + y SrO Ca(6 + x)Sry(HPO4)(4-x-y) (PO4)6-(4-x-y) + (10 + x + y) H2O (1) Material and methods DCPD (from Fluka) had a median particle size d 50 of 8 μm (d10–d90 = 1.6–27 μm; calculated specific surface area, 3.5 m 2 g, Mastersizer, Malvern Instruments) and was used as received. CaO (from Aldrich) was heated at 900°C for 2 h to remove H 2O and CO2 and stored in a vacuum desiccator. After heating, median particle size was around 7 μm (2–40 μm; calculated specific surface area = 4.3 m 2 g). SrO was prepared by heating Sr(OH) 2·8H2O (from Riedel-de-Haën) at 900°C for 2 h. Its XRD pattern complied with the JCPDS file 6-520 wit h a slight amorphous-like background. Mixtures (15 g) of DCPD, CaO and SrO in variable proportions depending on the desir ed Ca replacement by Sr and (Sr+Ca)/P ratios were ground in a planeta ry ball mill (Retsch Instruments: vial eccentricity on the rotating sun disc 3.65 cm) at a rotation vel ocity of 350 rpm with 5 balls, 2.5 cm in diameter (total mass 133 g and surface area 110 cm2). At dif ferent intervals, powder (50 mg) was taken for analysis. The DCPD content at the different inter vals was determined either by XRD (Philips PW3830X, CGR horizontal goniometer, Cu K α1 = 1.5405 Å, Ni filter), surface area of the DCPD peak at 5.80° θ (plane (0 2 0)) after baseline subtraction or by DSC (DSC6 P erkinElmer), Key Engineering Materials Online: 2003-12-15 ISSN: 1662-9795, Vols. 254-256, pp 103-106 doi:10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.254-256.103 © 2004 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland All rights reserved.

	abstract = {Summary . In childhood acute lymphobastic leukemia [ALL] skeletal changes are frequently found at the time of diagnosis and treatment, including: metafyseal lines, periostal reaction, lysis, sclerosis, osteoporosis and occasionally spontaneous fracture. Different factors, including the disease itself, may be responsible for a defective bone homeostasis in these patients. Solubil products of malignant cells like the osteoclast activated factor (OAF), lymphotoxin, IL-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and other cytokines may cause bone demineralization. Citotoxic drugs, like methotrexate corticosteroids and radiotherapy, have been incriminated as elements of the treatment that may cause bone changes. Prospective analysis of the bone and mineral status in 108 children with ALL was performed. Markers of bone turnover (Ca, P, Mg homeostasis in urine and serum, osteocalcin and PTH) were measured before the initiation of the therapy, on the 28 th day of therapy and six months after it. The bone mass was determined on the x-ray and densitometry was measured. At the time of diagnosis musculoskeletal pain was present in 37.5% of patients. It was common in children with better prognosis (CD 10 immunophenotype, low leucocytes count, L1-morphology). We found hypocalcemia, hypomagnesaemia and calciuria. PTH and osteocalcin decreased at the time of diagnosis 80% children with ALL had decrease bone mineral density.},

Preterm infants whose diet is deficient in copper and/or zinc may suffer anemia, anorexia, skin changes, diarrhea, growth retardation, impaired connective tissue formation, osteoporosis, and impaired cell mediated immunity as well as failure to thrive. The fetus stores 70% of its body reserve of copper and zinc in the last trimester, indicating that the premature infant has low reserves of cooper and zinc at delivery. They may not amass or develop body stores in the same was as does the fetus. Premature infants receiving pasteurized breast milk have a negative zinc balance for at least the first 60 days of life and a negative copper balance for the first 35 days of life. Parental nutrition without copper and zinc supplements result in deficiency conditions. Some oxidation-reduction reactions using oxygen may generate free radicals; with ventilators delivering oxygen directly into the alveoli, generated free radicals may pulmonary oxygen toxicity. This condition is called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Preterm infants without hyaline membrane disease are more likely to support hyperopic increase of pulmonary superoxide dismutase (SOD) (a free radical scavenger) activities than those with hyaline membrane disease (e.g., plasma samples, 88.5% vs. 33%). This suggests that preterm infants with the condition do not have a plasma factor needed for pulmonary SOD response. A possible factor is ceruloplasmin. Copper and zinc are important components of both SOD and ceruloplasmin. More research is needed to examine serial levels of copper, zinc, SOD, and ceruloplasmin in newborns to determine whether postnatal levels are linked to associated morbidities. In the event of failure of vitamin E therapy, administration of bovine SOD to premature infants may prevent and reduce the severity of BPD. In developing countries, physicians should prevent BPD and other chronic problems of premature infants by administering antioxidants with copper and zinc.},

This chapter of the “Les Entretiens du Carla” reviews the potential of nutritherapy for the prevention or improvement of sarcopenia, which is the progressive reduction in muscle mass and muscle strength prevalent in late-life. It is critical that we review nutrients and their potential to maintain muscle mass and strength which ultimately will help minimize falls and fractures among the older population. Evidence from randomized-controlled trials will be reviewed for muscle mass as well as important sarcopeniarelated endpoints including lower extremity strength and function, as well as falls and fallrelated fractures. This chapter will focus on vitamin D as a compelling strategy with evidence for strength gain, fall and fracture prevention from double-blind randomized controlled trials. The other strategy discussed is increased protein intake although longer-term trials and evidence for clinically important endpoints are limited. Today, there is no consistent data on other micronutrients or macronutrients with an established potential to combat sarcopenia.

A 1999 landmark publication in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) by LeBoff and colleagues documented a 50% prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency among postmenopausal women admitted with acute hip fracture (serum 25(OH)D levels < 30 nmol/l)[10]. The authors suggested in 1999 that heightened awareness is necessary to ensure adequate vitamin D nutrition, especially as vitamin D deficiency is preventable. The high prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency among hip fracture patients has been confirmed in the early and late nineties by several studies from Europe (11-19). According to Swiss data published in 2008, the prevalence of severe 25(OH)D deficiency is still significant and basically unchanged compared to earlier data with a more than 50% prevalence of severe deficiency among hip fracture patients admitted from home and a 75% prevalence of severe deficiency among those admitted from institutions (20). Notably, less than 10% of 222 hip fracture patients investigated had any dose of vitamin D supplementation upon admission to acute care (20). Most vulnerable to low vitamin D levels are older individuals (21, 22), individuals living in northern latitudes with prolonged winters (23, 24), obese individuals (25), and African Americans of all ages (26-28). Older individuals are at high risk of low vitamin D status because of the decreased production of vitamin D in the skin with age after sun exposure, which is 4-fold lower compared to younger adults (29). Furthermore, among older adults and within Europe lowest 25hydroxyvitamin D levels are measured in Southern Europe (30), which may be explained by sun avoidance and sun protection at older age. Finally, nutritional sources of vitamin D are rare and are mostly limited to fatty fish, such as salmon, which is not regularly consumed in 2 servings and each day (31). Additionally, food fortification with vitamin D is not practiced in Europe as it is in the US, although the small benefit of about 200 IU vitamin D through consumption of fortified milk or orange juice in the US is small and did not prevent a further decline in 25hydrocyvitamin D status among US adults as documented in the newest NHANES study (oral presentation of Prof. Bess Dawson-Hughes; IANA conference Boston 2007). Vitamin D: its role in muscle health In humans, four lines of evidence support a role of vitamin D in muscle health and the prevention of sarcopenia. First, proximal muscle weakness is a prominent feature of the clinical syndrome of vitamin D deficiency. Second, VDR is expressed in human muscle tissue, and VDR activation may promote de novo protein synthesis in muscle (32). Third, several observational studies suggest a positive association between 25hydroxyvitamin D and muscle strength or lower extremity function in older persons (33, 34). Finally, in several doubleblind randomized controlled trials, vitamin D supplementation increased muscle strength and balance (35, 36), and reduced the risk of falling in community-dwelling individuals (36-38), as well as in institutionalized individuals (35, 39). Notably, a study by Glerup and colleagues suggest that vitamin D deficiency may cause muscular impairment even before adverse effects on bone occur (40). Mice without the VDR develop a skeletal muscle phenotype with smaller and variable muscle fibers and persistence of immature muscle gene expression during adult life (41). These abnormalities persist after correction of systemic calcium metabolism by a rescue diet (42). Vitamin D: desirable vitamin D status for better function and lower risk of sarcopenia A dose-response relationship between vitamin D status and muscle health was examined in NHANES III including 4100 ambulatory adults age 60 years and older. Muscle function measured as the 8-foot walk test and the repeated sit-to-stand test was poorest in subjects with the lowest 25-hydroxyvitamin D (below 20 nmol/l) levels. Similar results were found in a Dutch cohort of older individuals (33). Notably, while from the smaller Dutch cohort a threshold of 50 nmol/l has been suggested for optimal function (33), a threshold beyond which function would not further improve was not identified in NHANES III even beyond the upper end of the reference range (> 100 nmol/l)[34] with a similar benefit by gender, level of physical activity, and calcium intake. With respect to sarcopenia, appendicular skeletal muscle mass was measured in the Dutch cohort among 331 older adults using dual-energy xray absorptiometry. After a 3-yr follow-up, and after adjustment for physical activity level, season of data collection, serum creatinine concentration, chronic disease, smoking, and body mass index, persons with low (<25 nmol/l) baseline 25hydroxyvitamin D levels were 2.14 (0.73-6.33, based on muscle mass) times more likely to experience sarcopenia, compared with those with higher (>50 nmol/l) levels. The associations were similar in men and women. Vitamin D: weakness / sarcopenia Muscle weakness is a prominent feature of the clinical syndrome of vitamin D deficiency. Clinical findings in vitamin D deficiency myopathy include proximal muscle weakness, diffuse muscle pain, and gait impairments such as waddling way of walking (43). The VDR is expressed in human muscle tissue (44), and vitamin D bound to its nuclear receptor in muscle tissue may lead to de novo protein synthesis (32, 45). One uncontrolled biopsy trial in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis documented a relative increase in the diameter and number of type II muscle fibers after a 3 month treatment with 1-alpha-calcidiol (32). These findings were confirmed by three recent double-blind RCTs with 800 IU vitamin D3 resulting in a 4-11% gain in lower extremity strength or function (35, 36), and an up to 28% improvement in body sway (36, 38) in older adults age 65+ between 2 to 12 month of treatment.

The steroids in them affect the metabolism of hormones, vitamins, trace elements, carbohydrates, proteins and lipids. The changes, however, are minimal, and the steroid content has decreased over the years. The liver toxicity of currently used pills is small. Serum amino transferase values need to be checked once during the 1st 3-6 months of use, although routine liver tests have been halted. Contraceptive pills cause fluid retention and weight increase because of the estrogens. Progestin increases the secretion of water and natrium. Osteoporosis, however, does not develop. Contraceptive pills do not cause diabetes, although blood sugar increases more than average during the glucose tolerance test. Some progestins have a poor anabolic effect. The ethinylestradiol pill increases the content of some liver-based proteins in the circulation. Smoking is an important risk factor because it increases changes in the content of coagulation factors and antithrombin III. The progestin component determines the effect of the pill on lipoproteins. Changes in the cholesterol and triglycerides have remained minimal, as the estrogen-progestin content of the pill has been decreased. A new product that acts antiandrogenically has been developed for contraception by those suffering from acne.},

Zinc is a structural/functional component in more than 200 enzymes active in the biochemistry of cell division and tissue growth, neurology and endocrine control. Calcium is involved in intracellular control mechanisms and in skeletal bone building and resorption processes related to osteoporosis. Sensitive and selective laser photoionization is being developed to understand mechanisms in smaller samples and biological units approaching the cellular domain. Zinc has an ionization potential of 9.4 eV, or 75766.8 cm-1. Several processes are being explored, including two-photon resonant, three- photon ionization utilizing sequential UV transitions, e.g., 4s2 1S0 yields 4s4p 3P1 and 4s4p 3P1 yields 4s5d 3D1. Preliminary zinc stable isotope ratio data obtained by thermal atomization and laser photoionization agree with accepted values within 2 to 5%, except for anomalous 67Zn. Photoionization of calcium is being studied for isotope enrichment and ratio measurement using narrow and medium bandwidth lasers. Several ionization pathways, e.g., 4s2 1S0 - 2hv1 yields 4s10s - hv2 yields Ca+ (4s2S), are being investigated for isotopically selective ionization. Auto-ionization pathways are explored for greater efficiency in isotopic analysis. All studies have utilized a Nd:YAG- pumped laser system with one or two frequency-doubled tunable dye lasers coupled either to a magnetic sector or time-of-flight mass spectrometer.},

	abstract = {For sustainable development, to assure health care services and for the protection of the human environment to ensure a quality of life, the knowledge of concentration on the environmental constituents is very much essential. In recent years the study of elements, both major and traces, especially related to environment has assumed increasing importance because of their vital role in human health and diseases. Fluorine is an essential element for both plant and animal life. A high incidence of caries has been shown by many investigators to be correlated with low fluorine inta:ke••. Excess intake of fluorine results in toxic symptoms described as fluorosis that causes many diseases like arthritis, I . 61719-20 Th ,.. h . ffl . ameness, pam on movement, etc · · . ere,ore t e concentratwn o uorme in drinking water is very important for human health. Nuclear analytical technique Proton Induced Gamma Emission (PIGE) method developed in the Van de Graaff Accelerator Laboratory of Atomic Energy Centre, Dhaka (AECD) was employed for the quantitative determination of fluorine in some water of Dhaka and its adjacent areas. Ion beam analysis technique PIGE was employed for the measurement of fluorinfi. because it is suitable and reliable for the analysis of fluorine content in water, b'i~a'il;e the determination of Fluorine is very difficult by non-ion beam techniques•. The fluorine concentration in the drinking water of Dhaka ranges from 0.01 ppm to 0.46 ppm. The study indicates that the inhabitants of Dhaka have low intake of fluorine from their drinking water supplies. INTRODUCTION AND ARTICULATION OF THE PROBLEM To ascertain human health and a quality life, monitoring of environmental pollution and identification of pollution sources is of much importance. Such studies will help thorough understanding of the environment and its effect on human life. In recent years the study of elements, both major and traces, in Environmental constituents has assumed increasing importance because of their vital role in human health and diseases. The major pathway of the elements to the human body is the food, drinks, and air. So from the point of view of environmental safety assessment it is necessary to have the information on the levels of both toxic and essential elements in environmental ingredients such as air, water, food, etc. Moreover, the possibility that contamination of the water supply and food items with trace elements, arising from geological bearing minerals, modern agriculture and industrial practices may have detrimental effects on the long term health and welfare of human population. This has stimulated increasing interest in the study on concentrations and movements of these elements in the environment and in the intakes by man. Fluorine, one of the 15 generally accepted essential elements, has long been recognized as a constituent of bones, teeth, soft tissues and body fluids·· . Criteria of adequacy and tolerance present particular problems with fluorine. Fluorine confers improved resistance to dental caries and is also necessary to assist in the maintenance of a normal skeleton and in the reduction of osteoporosis in the mature adult population. On the other hand, excessive fluoride intake causes fluorosis ·• which is a more common condition than the deficiency state. Therefore, Fluorine is recognized as an essential trace element, but toxic when the intake is sufficiently high and for long enough period. Drinking water is one of the major sources of fluorine for human population. In general surface waters used for drinking and cooking purposes in most communities has comparatively lower fluorine content. However, in some parts of the World the population is dependent on water from deep wells or artesian bores which could have higher fluorine content because the earth's crust in many regions of the world has fluoride bearing minerals · . Therefore, it is observed that in many countries of the world drinking water is contaminated with fluorine. For example in India an estimated 62 million people are sick due to fluorosis of which 6 million are children below the age of 14 years. It is for these reasons, the Central Ground Water Authority (CGW A) of India has warned the people not to consume water from shallow water bearing zones (up to 30 metres) in six blocks of the National Capital Territory of Delhi . The fluorine content in ground water scenario in India especially in the States bordering Bangladesh may make some one curious about the situation in Bangladesh. There is a possibility to have the fluorine bearing minerals in the ground water in Bangladesh too. The geological aspect of Bangladesh is very similar to India. Therefore, it is likely that the ground water of Bangladesh could be affected by unintentional natural fluorine. The knowledge of concentration of fluorine in drinking water and other foodstuffs is therefore very important from the point of view of human health and human environment. Such knowledge will help to estimate the fluorine intakes of the people and to evaluate any toxicity or deficiency. Similar studies could provide the better quantification of the effects of human environmental constituents that will help the detailed understanding of the environment and better management of the human environment. This will also help to evaluate and implement future},

	year = {2011},
	abstract = {Background. Silicon, the third most abundant trace element of the human body, is listed as an essential one. It is especially associated with connective tissues as it has been found to take part in bone development, collagen formation and mineralization of bone matrix. Silicon is also implicated in mammalian hormonal control and in protecting against heart disease in humans. Objectives. The influence of different doses of orally-administered silicon on calcium and magnesium concentrations in the blood of experimental animals was evaluated. Material and Methods. The experiment was carried out on male Wistar rats. A control group was given distilled water to drink. The rats in group 0 were given a solution of sodium hydroxide (0.001 mol/L), whereas animals in groups 1, 2 and 3 received solutions of orthosilicic acid of three different concentrations (0.05%, 0.5% and 1%) as the only drinking fluids. Blood was collected after 4 and then 8 weeks of the experiment. Determination of calcium and magnesium concentrations in the blood was performed by the ICP-AES method. Results. Silicon administration caused an increase in blood calcium concentration after 4 as well as after 8 weeks of the experiment. Four-week-long silicon intoxication caused a decrease in blood magnesium concentrations, whereas an increase in blood magnesium level in groups 0, 1 and 3 and a decrease in group 2 after 8 weeks of the experiment were noted. Conclusions. Silicon was found to significantly influence metabolism of calcium and magnesium. Its interaction with calcium during the process of bones mineralization suggests that Si supplementation may be helpful in preventing osteoporosis in postmenopausal women whose calcium intake is insufficient. Homeostasis in mineral metabolism and balance between elements are very important matters, therefore silicon metabolism and its interactions with other elements and nutrients should be further investigated (Adv Clin Exp Med 2011, 20, 6, 677–682).

	year = {2009},
	abstract = {Medical treatment of patients with liver cirrhosis consists mainly of symptomatic therapy of associated complications. Apart from the classical complications of cirrhosis, e. g. ascites, portal hypertension or hepatic encephalopathy, other frequent complications are neglected in everyday medicine. The incidence of metabolic disturbances seems to be similar to the prevalence of classical complications of liver cirrhosis, such as portal hypertension or ascites. Osteoporosis is an important manifestation of hepatic osteopathy, especially in chronic cholestatic diseases and in candidates for liver transplantation, which necessitates timely adequate diagnostic test (e. g. osteodensitometry) and treatment (pre-emptive and causal). Malnutrition, especially when related to protein- and energy supply, is very common in patients with liver cirrhosis and has prognostic significance regarding mortality and complication rates. A sufficient daily energy and protein supply should be ensured, one which is higher than that for the normal population. Additional substitution of vitamins and trace elements is indicated when symptoms of deficiency became apparent.},

	abstract = {Although the macrominerals calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium are of primary concern in bone health, other minerals, including trace minerals can also play an important role. In this chapter, the role of some of these will be considered. In general, the data supporting and defining the role of the trace minerals in bone health is much less well developed than for the macrominerals. There are early suggestions of the importance of a number of trace elements, but it has been difficult to isolate their individual effects or to study them systematically, especially in humans. Many studies have used animal models, which are difficult to extrapolate to humans. There are very few well-designed intervention studies in humans that address the importance of trace and ultratrace minerals in human bone metabolism. Those that have been carried out often use surrogate markers of bone turnover rather than outcomes such as bone mineral density or fracture risk. Other epidemiological studies have compared dietary intakes of certain trace elements and fracture risk or the risk of osteoporosis. These are confounded by the other lifestyle and socioeconomic factors that may cause such differences in dietary intakes. In addition, low-quality diets may be deficient in more than one nutrient, making it extremely difficult to ascribe the change to any single nutrient.},

	year = {1988},
	abstract = {These investigations into the effect of tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) on bone and cartilage development in the growing dog were initiated after similarities were noted between the radiographic appearance of bone lesions in TTM-treated rats and hypertrophic osteodystrophy (HOD) in dogs. HOD is a bone disease of unknown aetiology which affects young, large breed dogs. Copper deficiency frequently causes thickening of the growth plate cartilage and osteoporosis in the bones of many species. However, the type and severity of the bone lesions vary considerably between and within species. TTM is believed to exert its effects by antagonising copper and causing a functional deficiency of this trace element. The effects of TTM on the growth plate cartilage and bone morphology of dogs were examined in detail and the lesions compared with cases of HOD. The oral administration of TTM induced several signs of copper deficiency, including depletion of plasma and liver copper concentrations and depressed activity of copper-dependent enzymes. This technique of inducing copper deficiency allowed greater control over the severity of the bone lesions than would have been possible with copper-deficient diets. Lesions in bone were examined by radiography, gross pathology and histopathology. Bone metabolism and osteoporosis were investigated by histomorphometry, tetracycline bone labelling, bone ashing and bone densitometry. The growth plate cartilage matrix was examined by analysis of collagen and proteoglycan content and in vitro culture of chondrocytes. In thiomolybdate-treated dogs, the growth plate cartilage was thickened due to disordered provisional calcification associated with changes in the collagen and proteoglycans of the chondroid matrix. In addition, osteoporosis developed due to suppression of osteoblast activity. The histologic appearance of the lesions did not resemble that seen in the clinical disease HOD. It was concluded that TTM reduces the copper status of dogs and thereby causes changes in the matrix of the growth plate cartilage which affect the orderly progression of provisional calcification. Osteoporosis occurs due to decreased osteoblastic bone formation. The lesions were not typical of those seen in HOD.},

	year = {2010},
	abstract = {Characteristics of strontium Strontium was discovered in 1790 in a mine close to the Scottish village Strontian and was isolated in 1808. Strontium is one of the alkaline earth metals and is never found in its free form in nature because it easily oxidises, forming strontium oxide. Strontium, along with calcium and magnesium belongs to group 2 of the periodic table which are divalent cations, which, in biological liquids can have different degrees of bonds with blood proteins. The binding to proteins of strontium is in the same order of magnitude as that of calcium. In the human body there are only traces of strontium. A normal diet supplies from 2 to 4 mg of strontium per day, although the quantity can be higher if the diet is rich in cereals or vegetables. Given the similarity in the behaviour of both elements, the radioisotopes of strontium have been used for kinetic studies of the metabolism of calcium. However, there are important biological differences between them, which are in part explained by the greater molecular weight of strontium. Common transportation pathways have been described, for example strontium competes with calcium in intestinal absorption and in renal tubular reabsorption. Strontium is absorbed less than calcium, this difference in the intestinal tract could be due, in part, to the smaller size of the calcium atom. On the other hand, the renal clearance of strontium is nearly three times greater than that of calcium, perhaps due to a greater secondary tubular absorption because of the larger size of the strontium atom. Relationship of strontium with bone The quantity of strontium in the skeleton is very small, and represents only 0.035% of the content of calcium. After its administration it is deposited almost exclusively in bone. Like sodium and lead, strontium can substitute for calcium in the position which it occupies in hydroxyapatite. In 1952, Shorr and Carter demonstrated that the addition of a moderate quantity of strontium lactate improves the deposition of calcium in the bone. One can say that this observation was the first suggestion in the literature that strontium could be useful in the treatment of alterations in bone metabolism. In 1959, McCaslin showed in a small study that in patients with osteoporosis strontium lactate reduced bone pain, at the same time as improving the X-ray images of demineralisation. However, these observations did not awaken great interest in the researchers of that time, probably due to the mineralisation defects which a high dose of strontium was known to produce. Subsequently, in the 90s, from the study of Marie et al., various researchers confirmed progressively and uniformly, that strontium ranelate reduced bone resorption, maintaining formation and increasing bone volume without inducing mineralisation defects.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with the development and applications of a multipurpose spectrometer that is still evolving from its origins in curiosity-motivated research. To some extent, the instrument competes with existing techniques, particularly Xray fluorescence (XRF) and proton induced X-ray emission (PIXE), but we shall stress the capabilities that are complementary to those of the more established techniques. Both XRF and PIXE are used most frequently, although not exclusively, in the trace-element analysis of thin specimens. Characteristically, XRF and PIXE employ high-resolution Si(Li) detectors in situations where severe matrix-absorption effects require elaborate computer-based analysis (1, 2) of X-ray spectra. The approach adopted here is to use an instrument of very high efficiency but modest resolution for the analysis of infinitely thick specimens and to combine three types of analysis to sense elements of all atomic numbers. We use the fluorescent K X rays to identify individual elements with Z 2 20; the ratio of Rayleigh to Compton scattering (R/C ratio) is used for Z 2 10 and the shape of the Compton profile for all Z, but in both of these analyses, the specimen is treated only as a binary mixture. We describe first the historical development of the measuring technique, emphasizing its origin in research on electronmomentum distributions in solids, initially in the area of positron annihilation and subsequently, in the closely related field of Compton profiles. A brief description of the measuring system is followed by a detailed discussion of the source and source holder, components that play particularly important roles in determining the performance of the system. The new Canadian dollar coin provides a remarkably challenging test of nondestructive analysis and we treat this application in detail. A new technique of analysis based on the shape of Compton profiles, DuMond spectrometry, is introduced and applied to standardized bone-wax mixtures; this is part of a research program on developing a low-dose test for osteoporosis. We then consider the exploration for elusive elements by identification of associated elements, known to geologists as pathfinders. Finally, we consider the for},

	abstract = {This book examines different aspects of nutrition and bone health. The volume includes 32 chapters written by European and international authors who are actively involved in research in this field. The book is divided in six sections. The first section consists of six chapters giving background information on osteoporosis, the epidemiology of osteoporosis and nonnutritional factors related to bone fragility. One chapter is dedicated to the role of genetics in osteoporosis. In addition, rickets, osteomalacia and other metabolic bone diseases and the influence of nutrition are covered. The last chapter deals with assessment of dietary intake and nutritional status. The second section, comprising three chapters, addresses the role of calcium and vitamin D in bone health, starting with an overview on nutritional aspects of bone growth, followed by the role of calcium in maximising peak bone mass. Furthermore, the role of calcium in reduction of postmenopausal bone loss and fracture prevention is covered. In the chapter on intestinal calcium absorption, methods for studying calcium absorption and factors affecting calcium absorption are discussed. The important role of vitamin D in fracture prevention is addressed in the last chapter in this section. Four chapters are included in the third section. Here are presented the effect of low and high protein intake, and of phosphorus and sodium on the skeleton. Furthermore, the role of the skeleton in acid–base homeostasis is discussed, focusing on vegetable and fruit consumption and on mineral waters. There are seven chapters in the fourth section. They deal with vitamin K, magnesium, trace elements, vitamin A, food groups, soy isoflavones, alcohol and caffeine and bone health. The fifth section is the largest, with nine chapters. This section starts with the twin model approach, followed by nutrient–gene interactions. Two chapters are dedicated Asian and Middle East populations. Thereafter the interaction among physical health, nutrition and bone health is discussed. The last chapters have a more clinical approach: interaction of nutritional factors with medication, weight reduction and bone, eating disorders and bone health, and the effect pregnancy and lactation on the skeleton. The sixth section with three chapters addresses bone health from a public health point of view. The first chapter deals with an important question: can nutrition alter the population burden of fractures? The authors conclude there are many areas of ignorance regarding the effects of nutrients on skeletal growth and ageing. However, the most opportune period in life for interventions seems to be during growth, but the optimal time period has not been established. In addition, investigation of the efficacy of calcium and vitamin D in high-risk groups has demonstrated a role in fracture prevention in such individuals. We do not know the effect in low-risk individuals. The next chapter discusses the cost-effectiveness of nutritional supplements. However, the only supplements that have been studied are calcium and vitamin D. The last chapter is dedicated to nutritional strategies for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. The author presents comprehensive strategies for both individuals as well as professional groups: health professionals, industry and agriculture as well as policy-makers. The author concludes that when asked the question ‘Who needs nutritional osteoporosis prevention?’, we should remember that ‘we all do, throughout life, because stronger bones are harder to break than weak ones’. The book provides an overview on the different aspects of nutrition and bone health. Each chapter forms a complete entity. All chapters are well referenced, but not completely covering all relevant issues. Why are only dietary assessment methods presented in the chapter on nutritional assessment, although biochemical methods are of great importance? In addition, the role of vitamin D in children, adolescents and adults is not discussed at all, although there are studies on this subject. The grouping of the chapters is not quite logical among the sections. Why is magnesium considered in section 4, phosphate in section 3 and calcium in section 2, although all play a role in mineral metabolism? Why is the measurement methodology for bone mineral density presented on page 568 in the chapter on treatment of osteoporosis and interaction of medications with nutrition and not earlier, even though it is one of the main outcomes in the study of bone health? The same applies for the markers of bone turnover. Why is the twin model introduced as one of the chapters in section 5, although this description of methodology and some applications have been referenced in earlier chapters? As the chapters have been written by different authors, the writing styles and the approaches to the subjects differ,},

	year = {2019},
	abstract = {Importance of adequate calcium intake on formation of bone mass has been proved for children and teenagers, but the effect of calcium supplementation during infancy is yet to be established. An increase in peak bone mass by calcium supplementation during skeletal formation may contribute to osteoporosis prevention. We evaluated the effect of calcium supplementation in suckling rats on bone calcium content and essential element concentrations immediately after supplementation period and on bone mineral density (BMD) at the age of 2 months. Forty-eight female suckling rats (Wistar) were artificially fed on cow's milk or on cow's milk supplemented with 6% calcium (as Ca-hydrogen phosphate) to increase the daily calcium intake about 3 times above control values. Treatment lasted 7 hr a day for nine consecutive days, from day 6 through 14 after birth. At the end of supplementation period, 18 sucklings (9 non-supplemented and 9 calcium- supplemented) were killed and calcium concentration in the carcass (whole body after removal of the organs, total gastrointestinal tract, and skin) was analysed by atomic absorption spectrometry. Calcium supplementation was associated with an increase in carcass calcium concentration by about 17% compared to non-supplemented pups. Growth and concentrations of trace essential elements in carcass and organs were not affected. Other 30 suckling rats (15 non-supplemented and 15 calcium-supplemented) weaned on feed with marginal calcium (0.33%) and were fed on the same test diet during 7 weeks. At the end of this period, total body BMD was measured in 2-month- old rats by densitometry using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (Lunar DPX, Madison, WI, USA) in ketamine and xylazine anesthesia. No difference was found between groups in relation to calcium supplementation during the suckling period. These results confirm findings from our previous investigation in which calcium supplementation during the suckling period had no effect on BMD in 3-month-old female rats fed on either 1% or 0.45% calcium diet. It is concluded that calcium supplementation during the suckling period increases the calcium concentration in bones, but it has no influence on bone mineral density in adolescence, even under condition of marginal calcium intake.},

	year = {2020},
	abstract = {Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is a horticultural crop generally consumed either fresh or processed such as tomato ketchup, puree, soup and salsa (Helyes et al., 2009; Ray et al., 2011). Tomatoes and their products are popular nutritive food and are considered good source of minerals, vitamins and antioxidants (Afzal et al., 2013). Macro and microelements along with vitamins A and C are present in tomato fruit that strongly support health of human hence its consumption is increasing globally (Nour et al., 2013). The fresh tomato fruit (100g) is rich in vitamins i.e. A (28%), C (21%); mineral nutrients i.e. potassium (5%), sodium (1%), calcium (1%), magnesium (6.5%), zinc (1.5%), iron (4%) manganese (3.5%) and water 95% (Mark et al., 2013; USDA, 2017). Tomato is used in daily food in a variety of dishes due to its nutritive values and is also an excellent source of antioxidant compounds such as β-carotene, lycopene and polyphenols (Samad et al., 2017). Lycopene is the most robust antioxidant while β-carotene compound is source of vitamin A in human diet (Luthria et al., 2006; Borguini and Torres, 2009). Epidemiological studies revealed that lycopene alleviates heart diseases, stomach and prostate cancer (Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2011). Additionally, tomato has been reported effective in the treatment of eye diseases, inflammation and osteoporosis (Singh et al., 2014). Lycopene compound is a member of carotenoids family and it is a lipophilic in nature that dissolves in organic solvent (Bungheze et al., 2011). Most prominent phytochemicals in tomato are carotenoids, of which lycopene is the most abundant in the ripened fruit, accounting for approximately 80-90% of the total pigments (Hernández-Suárez et al., 2007; Helyes et al., 2009). Tomato contains a multitude of vitamins and minerals that act to support human health. They are an excellent source of vitamin C, potassium, and trace elements, i.e. selenium, copper, manganese and zinc, which are cofactors of antioxidant enzymes (Borguini and Da Silva Torres, 2009; Luthria et al., 2006). Nutritional quality of fruit is associated with various factors, i.e. environment (temperature, light, water, air composition and nutrient availability), genetics (genotype-environment interaction), agriculture practices (plant growth regulators, varieties, irrigation, training system and ripening stage) and storage conditions (Marsic et al., 2011; Haider et al., 2013, Pak.

	abstract = {Objectives: To study the relationship of indicators of muscle mass, muscle strength and muscle function with bone mineral density (BMD) in men with coronary heart disease (CHD). Methods: 79 men aged over 50 years with verified CHD were examined (mean age 63 (57; 66) years). The BMD (g/cm2) and T-criterion (standard deviation) of the femoral neck and lumbar spine (L1-L4) were evaluated using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) on the lunar Prodigy Primo bone densitometer (USA). To assess muscle mass, the total area (cm2) of the lumbar muscles of the axial section at the level of the 3rd lumbar vertebra (L3) was determined using multispiral computed tomography on a 64-slice computer tomograph “Somatom Sensation 64” (Siemens AG Medical Solution, Germany). The ratio of the obtained index of the area of skeletal muscle to the square of the patient’s growth index determined the “musculoskeletal index L3” (SMI). The media considered the threshold value to be 52.4 cm2/m2. Evaluation of muscle strength was performed using a mechanical wrist dynamometer DC-25. Muscle function was examined using a short physical performance battery (SPPB). Results: The data obtained from the results of correlation analysis show that there is a reliable direct correlation between BMD and hand dynamometry indicators (r=0.250; p=0.026 for the right hand and r=0.247; p=0.028 for the left hand), the T-criterion of the femoral neck and hand dynamometry indicators (r=0.245; p=0.030 for the right hand and r=0.242; p=0.032 for the left hand). A similar relationship was established between the BMD of the lumbar vertebra and the parameters of dynamometry (r=0.237; p=0.036 for the right hand and r=0.228; p=0.043 for the left hand) and T-criterion for the lumbar region and dynamometry parameters (r=0.232; p=0.039 for the right hand and r=0.220; p=0.051 for the left hand). There is no significant relationship between densitometry scores and the result of SPPB tests. There was a significant direct relationship between the total SPPB score and the area of skeletal muscle at the L3 level (r=0.249, p=0.026), the total SPPB score and the musculoskeletal index (r=0.233, p=0.039). A similar relationship was established between the result of the chair lift test and the total area of skeletal muscle at the L3 level (r=0.262, p=0.019) and the musculoskeletal index (r=0.220, p=0.050). A significant negative relationship between walking speed and the musculoskeletal index was found (r= -0.260, p=0.021). The relationship between muscle mass and strength could not be traced. Conclusion: A decrease in muscle strength correlates with the severity of bone loss, while a decrease in muscle function correlates with a decrease in muscle mass. The results obtained confirm the probability of common mechanisms in the development of sarcopenia and osteoporosis in patients with CHD. Disclosure of Interests: None declared},

	year = {2002},
	abstract = {Studies suggest that cadmium is associated with several clinical complications, primarily renal dysfunction and bone disease, but also some cancers. Cadmium toxicity has been associated with clinical manifestations at exposure levels that are well below the limits set by the World Health Organization. Here I review the OSCAR study, which demonstrates an association between environmental and occupational cadmium exposure and renal tubular damage, as well as the Cadmibel study, a cross-sectional population study demonstrating an association of cadmium exposure with renal dysfunction. The paper also reviews the association of end-stage renal disease prevalence with occupational and environmental exposure to cadmium in the Swedish population of Kalmar County. Renal tubular damage was shown to develop at levels of exposure much lower than previously thought. Cadmium-induced tubular proteinuria is irreversible, and continued exposure may lead to glomerular damage with decreased glomerular filtration rate. Itai-itai disease in the Jinzu river basin is discussed, as are the implications of low-level cadmium exposure in the PheeCad project. Cadmium accumulates in bone and is associated with osteomalacia and osteoporosis. Other bone-seeking trace elements, such as chromium, lanthanum, strontium and zinc, are of concern because of low level environmental, occupational or clinical exposure. As techniques are perfected for detecting smaller amounts of trace elements in various tissues in the body, investigators are finding that the threshold for toxicity from trace elements is much lower than expected. Further research on cadmium is necessary to reveal the mechanisms of toxicity and true environmental and occupational exposure limits.},

	year = {1998},
	abstract = {Abstract Few other aspects of food supply and metabolism are of greater biological importance than the feeding of mothers during pregnancy and lactation, and of their infants and young children. Nutritional factors during early development not only have short-term effects on growth, body composition and body functions but also exert long-term effects on health, disease and mortality risks in adulthood, as well as development of neural functions and behaviour, a phenomenon called ‘metabolic programming’. The interaction of nutrients and gene expression may form the basis of many of these programming effects and needs to be investigated in more detail. The relation between availability of food ingredients and cell and tissue differentiation and its possible uses for promoting health and development requires further exploration. The course of pregnancy, childbirth and lactation as well as human milk composition and the short- and long-term outcome of the child are influenced by the intake of foods and particularly micronutrients, e.g. polyunsaturated fatty acids, Fe, Zn and I. Folic acid supplementation from before conception through the first weeks of pregnancy can markedly reduce the occurrence of severe embryonic malformations; other potential benefits of modulating nutrient supply on maternal and child health should be further evaluated. The evaluation of dietary effects on child growth requires epidemiological and field studies as well as evaluation of specific cell and tissue growth. Novel substrates, growth factors and conditionally essential nutrients (e.g. growth factors, amino acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids) may be potentially useful as ingredients in functional foods and need to be assessed carefully. Intestinal growth, maturation, and adaptation as well as long-term function may be influenced by food ingredients such as oligosaccharides, gangliosides, high-molecular-mass glycoproteins, bile salt-activated lipase, pre- and probiotics. There are indications for some beneficial effects of functional foods on the developing immune response, for example induced by antioxidant vitamins, trace elements, fatty acids, arginine, nucleotides, and altered antigen contents in infant foods. Peak bone mass at the end of adolescence can be increased by dietary means, which is expected to be of long-term importance for the prevention of osteoporosis at older ages. Future studies should be directed to the combined effects of Ca and other constituents of growing bone, such as P, Mg and Zn, as well as vitamins D and K, and the trace elements F and B. Pregnancy and the first postnatal months are critical time periods for the growth and development of the human nervous system, processes for which adequate substrate supplies are essential. Early diet seems to have long-term effects on sensory and cognitive abilities as well as behaviour. The potential beneficial effects of a balanced supply of nutrients such as I, Fe, Zn and polyunsaturated fatty acids should be further evaluated. Possible long-term effects of early exposure to tastes and flavours on later food choice preferences may have a major impact on public health and need to be further elucidated. The use of biotechnology and recombinant techniques may offer the opportunity to include various bioactive substances in special dietary products, such as human milk proteins, peptides, growth factors, which may have beneficial physiological effects, particularly in infancy and early childhood.},

	title = {Cadmium overload and toxicity.},
	year = {2002},
	abstract = {Studies suggest that cadmium is associated with several clinical complications, primarily renal dysfunction and bone disease, but also some cancers. Cadmium toxicity has been associated with clinical manifestations at exposure levels that are well below the limits set by the World Health Organization. Here I review the OSCAR study, which demonstrates an association between environmental and occupational cadmium exposure and renal tubular damage, as well as the Cadmibel study, a cross-sectional population study demonstrating an association of cadmium exposure with renal dysfunction. The paper also reviews the association of end-stage renal disease prevalence with occupational and environmental exposure to cadmium in the Swedish population of Kalmar County. Renal tubular damage was shown to develop at levels of exposure much lower than previously thought. Cadmium-induced tubular proteinuria is irreversible, and continued exposure may lead to glomerular damage with decreased glomerular filtration rate. Itai-itai disease in the Jinzu river basin is discussed, as are the implications of low-level cadmium exposure in the PheeCad project. Cadmium accumulates in bone and is associated with osteomalacia and osteoporosis. Other bone-seeking trace elements, such as chromium, lanthanum, strontium and zinc, are of concern because of low level environmental, occupational or clinical exposure. As techniques are perfected for detecting smaller amounts of trace elements in various tissues in the body, investigators are finding that the threshold for toxicity from trace elements is much lower than expected. Further research on cadmium is necessary to reveal the mechanisms of toxicity and true environmental and occupational exposure limits.},

	doi = {10.1007/s00247-013-2759-1},
	year = {2013},
	abstract = {Sir, We are using this forum to share our recent experience with a 5-month-old child who had dramatic radiographic findings, in order to alert health care workers, including pediatric radiologists, about the increased likelihood of seeing copper deficiency cases in view of the scarcity of parenteral copper. Depending on the supply available, parenteral copper has been frequently omitted from total parenteral nutrition formulations in the last year or so [1]. A 5-month-old boy was transferred to our hospital for intestinal rehabilitation and evaluation for possible intestinal transplantation. He had been born at a gestational age of 34 weeks secondary to preterm labor. Prenatal US was concerning for polyhydramnios and intestinal obstruction. At birth he was found to have multiple small bowel atresias. After multiple surgeries for resections with reanastomosis, he remained dependent on parenteral nutrition and intolerant of enteral feeds. The child had been hospitalized since birth. The original chest/abdomen radiograph at our hospital showed vigorous periosteal reaction of humeri and femurs (sparing the region of the metaphysis) (Fig. 1) along with periosteal reaction of some ribs and the scapulae. Our original differential diagnoses included diffuse osteomyelitis, hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy, scurvy, vitamin D deficiency and child abuse. A bone survey then revealed osteoporosis (for example, the zone of provisional calcification of knee secondary centers could be seen better than the bone inside) and multiple metaphyseal abnormalities appearing as spurs (Fig. 2) and similar in some locations to “bucket handle” classic metaphyseal lesions of child abuse (Fig. 3). The pattern was somewhat suggestive of scurvy, a disease rarely seen in current practice. The other diagnoses considered were Menkes syndrome (kinky hair syndrome) and copper deficiency from inadequate intake. Vitamin C levels were normal, eliminating scurvy as a diagnosis. Recognition of the national shortage of intravenous micronutrients and trace elements led to evaluation of intake of copper in this boy with intestinal failure who had been dependent on total parenteral nutrition his entire life. It was discovered that because of the national shortage of parenteral copper, he had not received any copper at the referring hospital. A serum copper level showed a very low level of <10 μg/dL (normal 75–165 μg/dL), a very low ceruloplasmin level <4 mg/dL (normal 18–37 mg/dL), and alkaline phosphatase of 1,324 IU/L (normal 82–383 IU/L). Vitamin D, calcium and phosphorus levels were normal. He was anemic (hemoglobin 8.3 g/dL) on admission with normal white blood cell count. In the absence of any enteral feeds and knowledge of absence of copper in the total parenteral nutrition, the radiologic changes were attributed to acquired copper deficiency. Radiologic findings in this boy are consistent with prior reports of profound infantile copper deficiency [2, 3]. The exuberant extent of the periosteal reaction may well relate to the many weeks of normal in-patient handling of the baby without realizing he was bleeding subperiosteally. Copper deficiency leads to reduction of the activity of numerous copper-containing enzymes that are necessary for the structure and function of bone, skin, hair, blood vessels and the nervous system [4].

	abstract = {Abstract 2284 Background: Apheresis is an efficient method to collect specific blood components such as platelets, leukocytes, plasma and stem cells. Its advantages include: the collection of standardized and high-quality blood products and a higher collection frequency. However, apheresis is usually accompanied by acute metabolic changes (specially in serum calcium and magnesium concentrations) due to citrate infusion during the whole procedure. Aim: To compare pre and post-plateletpheresis serum level concentrations of calcium, magnesium, zinc, copper and parathyroid hormone among donors and correlate these levels with symptoms that donors may experience during the procedure performance. Materials and Methods: This is a prospective study including 105 healthy plateletpheresis donors who attended the National Cancer Institute. Basal and post-procedure serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) were measured by ion selective potentiometry (Ca), final dot (Mg), atomic absorption (Cu, Zn) and solid phase two site chemoluminiscence (PTH) methods. In case of adverse reactions, a blood sample was drawn immediately in order to analyze concentrations of such hormone and minerals. We intended to correlate both, diet and adverse reactions with serum levels of aforementioned elements. Statistical analysis was performed by chi-square and ANOVA. Protocol was approved by the institutional ethical and research committee. Results: One hundred and five consecutive donors were included in the study conducted from June 28th through July 27 th , 2012. There were 68 males and 37 females. Median age was 31 years (range 18–56). Pre and post-apheresis PTH, Ca, Mg, Zn and Cu serum levels are shown in table 1. Furthermore we found significant differences in women older than 30 years but did not find any relationship between donors9 symptoms and diet. Conclusions: Plateletpheresis induced a secondary hyperparathyroidism state resulting from chelation of calcium and magnesium. We demonstrated that Cu was also chelated by citrate. These results urges us to assess the kinetics of these metabolic changes as well as to follow a cohort of donors with bone densitometry in order to assure that frequent and chronic infusion of citrate during plateletpheresis donations does not become a long-term risk for osteopenia and osteoporosis as already suggested by some authors 1,2 . If such a risk is demonstrated other preventive measures must be implemented like: 1.- To restrict the number of apheresis donations per person and 2.- To develop new and safer anticoagulants to be used during the apheresis procedures. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.},

	title = {Determination of molybdenum in biological materials},
	doi = {10.1351/pac199163111627},
	year = {1991},
	abstract = {The accurate determination of molybdenum in biological materials is of considerable importance because of the essential role played by this element in human metabolism. However, data on the Mo content in biological samples and especially in clinical materials are often contradictory due to the inadequate sensitivity and reliability of the instrumental techniques used and to insufficient control of contamination during the analytical procedure. Despite recent developments in Mo determination by electrothermal atomic absorption and plasma atomic emission spectrometry, measurements in human blood and serum remain beyond the scope of most hospital laboratories involved in the usual routine testing. Further development of atomic spectrometric methods or a wider availability of neutron activation analysis may provide more data which is required for a better understanding of the nutritional role of Mo and its metabolism in humans. Advantages and limitations of the analytical techniques used for the determination of Mo in biological materials are critically discussed with particular attention given to clinical samples. The most common sources of analytical error are discussed and methods for their reduction are given. BIOCHEMICAL A N D CLINICAL BACKGROUND As early as 1953 (ref. 1) molybdenum was recognized to be an essential trace element for many species including man. It is a component of many enzymes responsible for the initial stages of nitrogen, carbon and sulfur metabolism of plants, animals and man and participates in a large number of enzymatic reactions (ref. 2,3). There is an absolute dependence by plants on Mo as it plays a vital role in the earth nitrogen cycle where it is involved both in nitrate reduction and nitrogen fixation. Although molybdenum is essential for animals it shows evidence of toxicity at high levels. General symptoms of excess doses of Mo for ruminants are: retarded growth, decreased milk and meat production, osteoporosis, severe gastroenteritis and coma (ref. 4). Cattle receiving feed containing high levels of available Mo develop copper deficiency diseases (Cu-Mo antagonisme) which may become lethal (ref. 5 ) . Molybdenum intoxication depends on its speciation and is also influenced by the uptake of other elements such as S"', W"', Cu, Pb and Zn. In humans, a deficiency of Mo in the diet may lead to some healths deffects. Diets with a low Mo content (20 pg/kg) adversely effect growth and may lead to neurogical disorders and even early death (ref. 6). Molybdenum also seems to play a positive role in the prevention of tooth decay (ref. 7). On the other hand, excess doses of Mo can be detrimental, persons having a diet rich in Mo being susceptible to gout, uricemia and xanthinuria and often suffer from an inflammation of extremities due to excess uric acid deposition (ref. 8,9). The practice of supplementing human diets with trace elements has stimulated studies of Mo as an essential nutrient. Several studies using diets providing between 1 and 14 pg of Mo per kg body weight per day report that an optimal diet should provide about 2 pg Mo per kg body weight per day (ref. 7). This result is comparable with a daily intake of 128 pg Mo proposed recently for a mixed diet composite (USDIET-I) (ref. 10). The Mo requirement for infants is closely reflected in the Mo content of breast milk (5-63 ndg) with the level depending on the time after parturition (ref. 11-14). It must be emphasized that studies of Mo metabolism in man have often be hampered by the lack of sufficiently sensitive analytical methods for monitoring Mo in human tissues and body fluids. For this reason in many cases it is difficult to determine whether the symptoms attributed to Mo defficiency or excess are due to biological variations or simply to experimental error. A better understanding of the role of Mo in human nutrition depends on improving the sensitivity and accuracy of the analytical methods involved. Only then will the biological function of Mo and the role of Mo as an essential trace nutrient be fully understood.},

	abstract = {Zusammenfassung Fragen zur Diät bei rheumatoider Arthritis werden in der Sprechstunde häufig gestellt. Trotz umfangreicher Literatur in der Laienpresse sind wissenschaftlich validierte Studien zu diesem Thema selten und in ihrer Aussage oft widersprüchlich. Der vorliegende Artikel befasst sich mit den wesentlichen Ansätzen zu einer diätetischen Beeinflussung des Krankheitsverlaufs. Eliminationsdiäten und Heilfasten sind auf das Weglassen potenziell entzündungsfördernder Nahrungsstoffe ausgerichtet.    Im Gegensatz dazu zielt die Zufuhr von Fischöl, Gamma-Linolensäure und Vitamin E auf eine anti-oxidative und anti-entzündliche Wirkung ab. Für beide Therapieansätze gibt es noch keinen überzeugenden Wirknachweis, vor allem in Hinblick auf objektive Krankheitszeichen. Auch die Substitution anderer Vitamine und Spurenelemente wie Vitamin A, C, Selen oder Zink ist nach bisherigen Erkenntnissen ohne Auswirkung auf den Krankheitsprozess.    Ein krankheitsbedingter Mehrbedarf besteht für Calcium und Vitamin D, besonders bei gleichzeitiger Steroidbehandlung zur Osteoporoseprävention. Bei aktiver RA ist zudem das kardiovaskuläre Risiko leicht erhöht. Die Indikation zu cholesterinsenkender Diätberatung und Medikation sollte daher frühzeitig gestellt werden.Summary Patients with rheumatic diseases frequently ask the physician for diet recommendations. Although much has been written about this subject, scientifically validated studies investigating the impact of certain diets on rheumatoid arthritis are scant and often inconclusive. Elimination diets or total fasting is believed to eliminate food ingredients that cause or aggravate arthritis. In contrast, supplementation with fish oil, gamma-linoleic acid or vitamin E is directed at anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of these food compounds. So far, both approaches have failed to reveal a significant benefit with respect to objective signs of inflammation. Supplementation with other vitamins such as vitamin A and C, or with trace elements like selenium and zinc are of no proven influence on the disease activity as well.    There is a higher request for calcium and vitamin D in patients with active RA under steroid treatment to prevent osteoporosis. In addition, patients with active RA have a slightly increased risk for cardiovascular events. Therefore, cholesterol-lowering diets and drugs should be applied early.},

	abstract = {With China’s increasing development of fisheries and aquaculture,there is an annual increase in the manufacture of aquatic products. Processing of aquatic products is associated with a large amount of waste products,in which fishbone and fishhead account for 45%. The waste products had been used as material of fish sauce and hydrolyzed protein,with high cost and complicated processes. How to efficiently utilize this kind of calcium source becomes focus in fish deep processing. Not only in China calcium deficiency is a prevalent nutritional disease,it has attracted the attention of the world because of its serious result. The lack of calcium intake leads to great interest in demand of calcium supplement and calcium fortification. Fishbone is a kind of natural calcium source. Until recently,researches on utilization of fishbone almost focused on freshwater fish,while no research on seawater fish was conducted to study biological effects on calcium supplement and bone fortification. So,investigating the possible use of waste products obtained after processing haddock,the present study prepared haddock bone calcium powder by NaOH and ethanol soaking (alkaline-alcohol method) and prepared haddock bone calcium tablets using the powder in combination with appropriate excipients. The biological efficacy of the haddock bone calcium tablets was investigated using Wistar rats as an experiment model. Results showed that the optimal parameters for the alkaline-alcohol method are as follows: NaOH concentration 1 mol/L,immersion time 30 h,ethanol concentration 60%,immersion time 15 h. The fish powder processed in this way has high quality in color and odor compared with that prepared in acid method. Contents of fishbone powder are as follows: calcium 27.8%,phosphors 12.2%,protein 3.67%,fat 0.44%. A mixture of 4% polyvinylpyrrolidone in ethanol was used as an excipient,and the ratio between full-cream milk powder and filler was 1∶2. Under these conditions,there is no necessity of the use of a disintegrating agent because disintegrating time is less than 12 min. This process provided satisfactory characters for tablets in terms of rigidity and taste. Animal studies showed that the haddock bone calcium tablets at a dose of 2 g/kg·d or 5 g/kg·d significantly increased blood calcium and phosphorus levels and bone calcium content in Wistar rats. Therefore,the haddock bone calcium tablets have a better biological efficacy than the traditional calcium carbonate formulation,promote bone growth,increase bone density and prevent osteoporosis. The absorption rate is crucial for nutrients. High absorption rates are usually directly related to the bioactivity of the nutrient. Although the reasons of high absorption in the rats fed with haddock bone calcium tablets are still unclear,it is suggested that some factors,such as treatment with method of alkaline-alcohol or the vitamin D in the added milk,may play positive roles in increasing absorption ratio. Some natural trace elements such as magnesium,iron and phosphorus may also be responsible for the high bioavailability of calcium derived from haddock fishbone relative to calcium carbonate. These researches provide a more effective way for economic utilization of fish bone derived from marine fish processing.},

	abstract = {The histomorphometric bone biopsy study obtained previous double tetracycline labeled, today is the “golden key” for the study of the mineral metabolic bone diseases. The transiliac bone biopsy is a safe proceeding. In the biopsy we analyzed the modeling and remodeling bone activity, both processes are performed by the same cells, but differ in the way that they are arranged. The main effect of modeling is to lead to changes in bone shape size and mass, whereas remodeling is to renew bone due to the few data on the modeling process, the following discussion will be focuses on remodeling. The bone remodeling is located mainly in the trabecular bone through a basic multicellular unit (BRU), which its main action consists of successive cycles of bone resorption and formation on the same trabecular surface. The BRU number is constant, its activity is asynchronous, the amount of bone removed is replaced (remodeling balance), the mineralizing surface is homogeneous and its individual time activity is constant. Any alteration of these qualities, leading to metabolic bone disease. Example: If the BRU increased in number, if their time of activity shortens and their mineralization surface increases, it means that there is a high remodeling bone disease. On the other hand, if the number of BRU diminished, if its time of activity enlarges and if its mineralizing surface is scanty, it showes the image of a low remodeling bone disease. The histomorphometric parameters are classified as structural parameters (amount of bone and size), resorption parameters (percentage osteoclasts, eroded surface and peritrabecular fibrosis), static formation parameters (percentage osteoblast, osteoid surface and osteoid thickness) and dynamic bone formation parameters, that show information about in vivo bone cell function (mineralizing surface, mineral apposition rate and others derived from these primary measures). We must take into account that the remodeling activity changes markedly with aging. We had few information about the metals bone levels; the bone biopsy allows us to know biochemical metals levels. Metabolic bone biopsy is indicated to establish specific diagnosis to prescribe treatments and some times to dilucidate prognosis. It is recommended to performed bone metabolic biopsy in renal osteodystrophies, osteogenesis imperfecta, idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, vitamin D dependent rickets, hypophosphatemic syndromes, chronic gastrointestinal conditions with bone disease, biliary atresia, primary hyperparathyroidism, pathological fractures, before any organ transplantation, in therapeutic protocols and toxicity or depletion of trace elements.},

	year = {1998},
	abstract = {THE EXPANDING USE of molecular techniques has had a highly positive effect on metabolic bone research, notably in the area of understanding the genetic influences that act to produce metabolic bone disease. However, examining the study designs and applications used in genetic studies of other chronic, multifactorial diseases, including heart disease, can motivate our use of a variety of genetic approaches in metabolic bone studies. We have an opportunity to see such application in the work by Klein et al. in this issue of the Journal, whose work can suggest potential candidate genes for encoding hormones, structural genes, and cell surface receptors. Typically, the first step into genetic studies is to inquire whether genetic factors play a role in determining the interindividual variability in phenotypic expression, typically a measure of bone mineral density (BMD) or fractures. There have now been almost two dozen clinical and epidemiological studies between 1973 and 1998 that suggest that BMD has a substantial familial or heritable component, some of which were reviewed by Pollitzer et al. With somewhat remarkable consistency, considering the diversity in population characteristics (age, ethnicity, gender, geographic location) and sample size, scientists have shown that ;40–60% of the variation in BMD is attributable to a heritable component. Indeed, of the common chronic diseases occurring in developed countries, BMD has one of the higher heritability fractions (40–60%), comparable to that of coronary artery disease and greater than the 30% heritability observed in hypertension. Thus, heritability of BMD is not an issue. The open questions revolve around the nature of the genetic constituents of this highly heritable and quantitative phenotype (BMD) and whether this can be related to fractures. With the infusion of energy and excitement generated by the work of Morrison and his colleagues, many investigators sought “the osteoporosis gene.” Dozens of investigations, some published and probably many not published, explored the relationship of the markers of the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Subsequently, the studies of the relationship between the vitamin D genotypes and the BMD phenotype have been inconsistent, generating an environment of frustration. This frustration about the inconsistencies in VDR studies and BMD has several sources. It is fueled by a research culture that seeks to identify “the” cause of a disease. Some investigators have reported statistically significant associations between BMD and the VDR only within subsets, usually defined by lifestyle or age characteristics. The lively exchange that has ensued, however, should cause us to rethink our expectations about understanding the genetic basis of metabolic bone diseases. First, because osteoporosis is a multifactorial disease, it is relatively unlikely that a single gene or even a very limited number of dominant genes will be responsible for explaining substantial amounts of variation in the phenotypic presentation as assessed by either bone densitometry or by fractures. Osteoporosis, like coronary artery disease, has a complex etiology. Genes will be involved in wide-ranging and varied elements crucial to the bone formation and maintenance processes. These processes, minimally, include functional products for the appropriate composition of matrix, responsiveness to remodeling activities, hormonal influences, and the nature and type of local growth factors. Genes associated with these processes will be acting in combination to determine the individual’s susceptibility (or resistance) to osteoporosis. While investigators focused on the VDR gene, there has been relatively less exploration of the genotypes associated with the other varied biochemical and physiological characteristics associated with bone mineralization, bone maintenance, and responsiveness to local or systemic regulators. It is increasingly recognized that there may be rare instances in which a single or small number of genes uniquely are associated with a disease (i.e., BRCA1 and subtypes of breast cancer); however, it is estimated that such a single gene explains ,5% of all breast cancer cases. The experience to date suggests that the likelihood is small that a single gene will be “the osteoporosis gene” and explain an overwhelmingly large propor-},

	abstract = {Metabolic Acidosis: Treat the Symptom or Cause of the Symptom? The description of bone decalcification as a consequence of endocrinologic pathologies or “other disturbances,” as it is stated in the publication of Miekeley et al seems to be over simplistic. The authors point out that the elevated mineral levels of calcium, magnesium, strontium and phosphorus in the hair tissue are related to the hyperactivity of the parathyroid and the thyroid glands. By extirpation of the parathyroid glands, the mineral levels returned to their normal concentrations. The choice of using surgical intervention to treat the endocrinologic pathologies avoids dealing with the original problem. It would be worthwhile to explore the underlying causes of the hyperactive parathyroid glands. As was described earlier, when metabolic acidosis drives the intracellular pH so low that it interferes with homeostasis alkali minerals, mainly calcium, are transferred from the blood to the inside of the cells to neutralize the acidic state (lactic, phosphoric, sulphuric, hydrochloric acids). When the well-buffered blood concentration of calcium sinks below the 9 mg% level, the parathyroid gland (PTG) is triggered to produce its hormone (PTH). PTH osteoclastic activity restores the blood level of calcium and this process is expressed by elevated calcium, magnesium and in certain cases phosphorus levels in hair and most likely in cells as well. Increased excretion of these elements in the urine can also be observed. The detrimental effect of the osteoclastic activity of the parathyroid gland induced by the presence of metabolic acidosis is well described by Wachman et al. stating that “the increased incidence of osteoporosis with age may present, in part, the result of a lifelong utilisation of the buffering capacity of the basic salts of bone for the constant assault against pH homeostasis. The loss of as little as 2 meq of calcium per day would, over a decade, assuming a total body content of 1 kg, account for a 15% loss of inorganic bone mass in an average individual”. The solution chosen by Miekeley et al. of eliminating the negative effects of the hyperactivity of the PTG, by extirpation of the parathyroid glands is characteristic. Instead of investigating the reason for the hyperactivity of the PTG, they have chosen to remove the symptom-causing gland. As a consequence, the osteoclastic activity of the PTH was definitely eliminated, but at cost of the other essential metabolic activities related to the PTG, such as: (a) control of serum levels of calcium and phosphorus; (b) regulation of urinary excretion of phosphate and calcium; (c) removal of calcium from bone, particularly if the dietary intake of calcium is inadequate; (d) regulation of serum alkaline phosphatase in case changes in bone have been produced; and (e) activation of vitamin D in renal tissue by increasing the rate of conversion of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol to 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol. As it was described earlier, the presence of metabolic acidosis will trigger a metabolic response, whether it is caused by lactic acid production (fermentation) instead of oxidative phosphorylation, or by consuming a diet with elevated protein content (which will produce an acid ash end productphosphoric acid), will trigger a metabolic response. The transfer of serum calcium to the tissues is attempting to neutralize the acid present there by salt formation (calcium lactate, calcium phosphate) and will trigger the production of PTH in order to maintain the 9-11% serum calcium level by its osteoclastic activity. The result will be expressed in loss of bone and in dental caries, and it will only be a question of time as to when the effect will also be demonstrable by bone densitometry. In the article of Miekeley it is stated},

	abstract = {39 child. In another chapter, Bondeson describes how the temperate movement espoused the belief of spontaneous combustion and alcohol to scare drinkers and relied on scientific articles supporting those claims. Bondeson's discussion of these curiousities also reflects upon the interpretations of human life and the phenomena of nature. In the later chapter devoted to the specimens of the Hunterian Museum in London, Bondeson depicts medicine's fascinations with freaks and their use as specimens of investigations into the workings of the human body. He describes how John Hunter unrelentlessly collected the bodies of these freaks-a pursuit that disregarded human dignity, leading to the dissection of a kidnapped child and the death of a giant man. Filled with pictures from the author's own historical collection, Medical Curiousities is well written and a pleasure to read. Although the author's interest in the topics is clearly obvious from his relaxed writing style, the great amount of thorough research done in preparation of this work is not lost upon the reader. In summary, Dr. Bondeson combines both scholarly research and schoolboy fascination to present an absorbing collection of medical curiousities. In the rush to make diagnoses and initiate treatments, we often overlook the importance of nutrition, perhaps forgetting that treatment goes beyond drug prescription. Fundamentals of Clinical Nutrition not only outlines nutrition's importance but also presents its basic concepts. Divided into three parts, the book begins with "Lifestyle, Diet, and Disease," an introduction to dietary trends and their significance in human development. Part I also includes a discussion of common diseases of modern society that have nutritional correlates, e.g., osteoporosis and obesity. This well-executed discussion demonstrates the significance of nutrition to the individual as well as to society, motivating the reader to begin learning about nutrition. Part II, entitled "Nutrients and Metabolic Processes," describes the biological importance of all the vitamins, minerals and trace elements. Each entry delineates the significance , source, metabolism and excretion, recommended dietary allowance signs of deficiency , and toxicity. Easy to read and find, this section makes a great reference with summarizing charts for quick access to information. The authors have also included color plates to illustrate signs of deficiency. Finally, Part III deals with nutrition and the hospitalized patient. The authors are concise and clear in their explanations of the different routes of feeding, outlining the pros and cons of each. Morgan and Weinsier also discuss the various types …},
