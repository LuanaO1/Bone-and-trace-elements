  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Life style and physical activity play a pivotal role in prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. The mechanism for better bone metabolism and improvement of physical disorders is not clear yet. Trace minerals such as Ca, Mn, Cu, and Zn are essential precursors for most vital biological process, especially those of bone health. OBJECTIVE: The main target of this study was evaluating the effective role of supervised aerobic exercise for 1 hour/day, 3 days/week for 12 weeks in the functions of trace elements in bone health through measuring bone mineral density (BMD), osteoporosis (T-score), bone markers, and trace element concentrations in healthy subjects aged 30-60 years with age average of 41.2{$\pm$}4.9. METHODS: A total of 100 healthy subjects (47 males, 53 females; age range 30-60 years) were recruited for this study. Based on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan analysis, the participants were classified into three groups: normal (n=30), osteopenic (n=40), and osteoporotic (n=30). Following, 12 weeks of moderate aerobic exercise, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), BMD, T-score, and trace elements such as Ca, Mn, Cu, and Zn were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. RESULTS: Significant improvement in serum BAP level, T-score, and BMD were observed in all participants following 12 weeks of moderate exercise. Participants with osteopenia and osteoporosis showed significant increase in serum Ca and Mn, along with decrease in serum Cu and Zn levels following 12 weeks of aerobic training. In control group, the improvements in serum trace elements and body mass index were significantly linked with the enhancement in the levels of BAP, BMD hip, and BMD spine. These results supported the preventive effects of moderate exercise in healthy subjects against osteoporosis. In both sexes, the changes in serum trace elements significantly correlated (P{$<$}0.05) with the improvement in BAP, BMD hip, BMD spine, and body mass index in all groups. CONCLUSION: The observed changes in the levels of Ca, Mn, Cu, and Zn were shown to be positively correlated with improved bone mass density among control and osteoporosis subjects of both sexes. These results demonstrate that aerobic exercise of moderate intensity might protect bone and cartilage by regulation of body trace elements which are involved in the biosynthesis of bone matrix structures and inhibition of bone resorption process via a proposed anti-free radical mechanism.},

We aimed to investigate serum selenium (Se), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and lipid (total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol) levels in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, osteopenia and in healthy controls, and to determine the relationship between Se, Zn, Cu and lipid parameters and bone mineral density (BMD). The study included 107 postmenopausal women; 35 healthy (group 1), 37 osteopenic (group 2) and 35 osteoporotic (group 3). The women in all three groups were carefully matched for body mass index (BMI). Serum concentrations of Se, Zn and Cu were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Plasma Se, Cu, Zn and lipid levels were similar in all groups (p\,{$>$}\,0.05). When we combined the women in each of the three groups, and considered them as one group (n\,=\,107) we found a positive correlation between BMI and lumbar vertebra BMD, femur neck BMD, femur total BMD; a positive correlation between TG and femur neck BMD, femur total BMD; a positive correlation between Zn and lumbar vertebra BMD (total T score) (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). There was no correlation between Se, Cu, Zn, P and lipid parameters (p\,{$>$}\,0.05). Although BMI has a positive effect on BMD, trace elements and lipids, except Zn and TG, did not directly and correlatively influence BMD. Further studies are needed to clarify the role and relationship of trace elements and lipid parameters in postmenopausal osteoporosis.},

  abstract = {Thyroid hormones stimulate bone turnover in adults by increasing osteoclastic bone resorption. TSH suppressive therapy is usually applied in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) to improve the disease outcome. Over the last decades several authors have closely monitored the potential harm suffered by the skeletal system. Several studies and meta-analyses have shown that chronic TSH suppressive therapy is safe in premenopausal women and men. Conversely, in postmenopausal women TSH suppressive therapy is associated with a decrease of bone mineral density, deterioration of bone architecture (quantitative CT, QCT; trabecular bone score, TBS), and, possibly, an increased risk of fractures. The TSH receptor is expressed in bone cells and the results of experimental studies in TSH receptor knockout mice and humans on whether low TSH levels, as opposed to solely high thyroid hormone levels, might contribute to bone loss in endogenous or exogenous thyrotoxicosis remain controversial. Recent guidelines on the use of TSH suppressive therapy in patients with DTC give value not only to its benefit on the outcome of the disease, but also to the risks associated with exogenous thyrotoxicosis, namely menopause, osteopenia or osteoporosis, age {$>$}60 years, and history of atrial fibrillation. Bone health (BMD and/or preferably TBS) should be evaluated in postmenopausal women under chronic TSH suppressive therapy or in those patients planning to be treated for several years. Antiresorptive therapy could also be considered in selected cases (increased risk of fracture or significant decline of BMD/TBS during therapy) to prevent bone loss.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis to evaluate effects on biochemical markers and urinary excretion of zinc (Zn) of calcitonin therapy. METHODS: Patients were required to have a bone mineral density (BMD) of 2.5 S.D. or more below the young adult mean either at the postero-anterior lumbar spine or at the femoral neck. Subjects were eligible for our study if they were 50 years or older, with at least 5 years of menopause, and in good general health as determined by medical history and a routine clinical blood analysis. The patients were randomly assigned to receive intranasal salmon calcitonin (200 IU/day; 50 patients) or placebo (50 patients). All patients received supplemental calcium (1000 mg/day). Additionally, 40 age-matched, demographically similar, healthy postmenopausal women were also selected as controls. Measurements of cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (uNTx), osteocalcin (sOC), and urinary zinc concentration were done. All parameters were measured before therapy and again after 1, 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: After 3 and 6 months of treatment, a higher decrease of most indices was observed in the calcitonin group. A statistically significant decrease occurred in the levels of sOC, uNTx and uZn after 3 and 6 months in patients receiving calcitonin therapy (P{$<$}0.05). Levels of sOC and uNTx in calcitonin group were significantly different after 3 and 6 months from both placebo and baseline values of calcitonin group (P{$<$}0.05). Levels of sOC, uNTx and uZn decreased about 40, 46 and 37\%, respectively, in calcitonin group at 6 months after the start of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that values of uNTx, uZn and sOC were significantly lower in the patient group than those in control group and in postmenopausal women with osteopororsis, calcitonin reduces the concentrations of uNTx, uZn and sOC.},

  abstract = {We compared the utility of the current Romanian guidelines that recommend treatment in women with a T-score {$\leq$}-2.5 SD with a FRAX-based intervention threshold equivalent to women with a prior fragility fracture. Whereas the FRAX-based intervention threshold identified women at high fracture probability, the T-score threshold was less sensitive and decreased markedly with age. PURPOSE: FRAX algorithm has been calibrated for Romania, but guidance is needed on how to apply fracture probabilities to clinical practice. METHODS: The age-specific 10-year probabilities of a major osteoporotic fracture were calculated at two potential intervention thresholds. The first comprised the age-specific fracture probabilities associated with a femoral neck T-score of -2.5 SD, in line with Romanian guidelines. The second approach determined age-specific fracture probabilities that were equivalent to a woman with a prior fragility fracture, without bone mineral density (BMD). The parsimonious use of BMD was additionally explored by the computation of upper and lower assessment thresholds for BMD testing. RESULTS: When a BMD T-score {$\leq$}-2.5 SD was used as an intervention threshold, FRAX probabilities in women aged 50 years were twofold higher than in women of the same age with an average BMD. The increase in risk associated with the BMD threshold decreased progressively with age such that, at the age of 80 years or more, a T-score of -2.5 SD was protective. The 10-year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture by age, equivalent to women with a previous fracture, rose from 5.3\% at the age of 50 years to 13\% at the age of 80 years and identified women at increased risk at all ages. CONCLUSION: Intervention thresholds based on BMD alone do not effectively target women at high fracture risk, particularly in the elderly. In contrast, intervention thresholds based on fracture probabilities equivalent to a "fracture threshold" targets women at high fracture risk irrespective of age.},

However, there are several other vitamins and minerals needed for metabolic processes related to bone, including manganese, copper, boron, iron, zinc, vitamin A, vitamin K, vitamin C, and the B vitamins. Although the recommended levels of nutrients traditionally related to bone were aimed to promote bone mass and strength, the recommended levels of the other nutrients that also influence bone were set on different parameters, and may not be optimal for bone health, in view of recent epidemiological studies and clinical trials.},

Cortical and trabecular bones consist of bone structural units (BSUs) such as osteons and bone packets of different mineral content and are separated by cement lines. Previous studies investigating trace elements in bone lacked resolution and therefore very little is known about the local concentration of zinc (Zn), strontium (Sr) and lead (Pb) in BSUs of human bone. We used synchrotron radiation induced micro X-ray fluorescence analysis (SR {$\mu$}-XRF) in combination with quantitative backscattered electron imaging (qBEI) to determine the distribution and accumulation of Zn, Sr, and Pb in human bone tissue., Fourteen human bone samples (10 femoral necks and 4 femoral heads) from individuals with osteoporotic femoral neck fractures as well as from healthy individuals were analyzed. Fluorescence intensity maps were matched with BE images and correlated with calcium (Ca) content. We found that Zn and Pb had significantly increased levels in the cement lines of all samples compared to the surrounding mineralized bone matrix. Pb and Sr levels were found to be correlated with the degree of mineralization. Interestingly, Zn intensities had no correlation with Ca levels. We have shown for the first time that there is a differential accumulation of the trace elements Zn, Pb and Sr in BSUs of human bone indicating different mechanisms of accumulation.,                                        \textbullet{}               The distribution of zinc, lead and strontium in the microstructure of human bone was analyzed for the first time.                                         \textbullet{}               Synchrotron induced micro X-ray fluorescence analysis was used in combination quantitative backscattered electron imaging.                                         \textbullet{}               Zn and Pb had significantly increased levels in the cement lines compared to bone matrix.                                         \textbullet{}               Pb and Sr levels were correlated with the degree of mineralization.                                         \textbullet{}               Zn intensities had no correlation with Ca levels.},

Bone growth retardation is a common finding in various conditions associated with dietary zinc deficiency. Bone zinc content has been shown to decrease in aging, skeletal unloading, and postmenopausal conditions, suggesting its role in bone disorder. Zinc has been demonstrated to have a stimulatory effect on osteoblastic bone formation and mineralization; the metal directly activates aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, a rate-limiting enzyme at translational process of protein synthesis, in the cells, and it stimulates cellular protein synthesis. Zinc has been shown to stimulate gene expression of the transcription factors runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) that is related to differentiation into osteoblastic cells. Moreover, zinc has been shown to inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption due to inhibiting osteoclast-like cell formation from bone marrow cells and stimulating apoptotic cell death of mature osteoclasts. Zinc has a suppressive effect on the receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis. Zinc transporter has been shown to express in osteoblastic and osteoclastic cells. Zinc protein is involved in transcription. The intake of dietary zinc causes an increase in bone mass. beta-Alanyl-L: -histidinato zinc (AHZ) is a zinc compound, in which zinc is chelated to beta-alanyl-L: -histidine. The stimulatory effect of AHZ on bone formation is more intensive than that of zinc sulfate. Zinc acexamate has also been shown to have a potent-anabolic effect on bone. The oral administration of AHZ or zinc acexamate has the restorative effect on bone loss under various pathophysiologic conditions including aging, skeletal unloading, aluminum bone toxicity, calcium- and vitamin D-deficiency, adjuvant arthritis, estrogen deficiency, diabetes, and fracture healing. Zinc compounds may be designed as new supplementation factor in the prevention and therapy of osteoporosis.},
