  abstract = {Bone may be similar to geological formulations in many ways. Therefore, it may be logical to apply laser-based geological techniques in bone research. The mineral and element oxide composition of bioapatite can be estimated by mathematical models. Laser-induced plasma spectrometry (LIPS) has long been used in geology. This method may provide a possibility to determine the composition and concentration of element oxides forming the inorganic part of bones. In this study, we wished to standardize the LIPS technique and use mathematical calculations and models in order to determine CaO distribution and bone homogeneity using bovine shin bone samples. We used polished slices of five bovine shin bones. A portable LIPS instrument using high-power Nd++YAG laser pulses has been developed (OpLab, Budapest). Analysis of CaO distribution was carried out in a 10\,\texttimes\,10 sampling matrix applying 300-{$\mu$}m sampling intervals. We assessed both cortical and trabecular bone areas. Regions of interest (ROI) were determined under microscope. CaO peaks were identified in the 200\textendash 500~nm wavelength range. A mathematical formula was used to calculate the element oxide composition (wt\%) of inorganic bone. We also applied two accepted mathematical approaches, the Bartlett's test and frequency distribution curve-based analysis, to determine the homogeneity of CaO distribution in bones. We were able to standardize the LIPS technique for bone research. CaO concentrations in the cortical and trabecular regions of B1\textendash 5 bones were 33.11\,{$\pm$}\,3.99\% (range 24.02\textendash 40.43\%) and 27.60\,{$\pm$}\,7.44\% (range 3.58\textendash 39.51\%), respectively. CaO concentrations highly corresponded to those routinely determined by ICP-OES. We were able to graphically demonstrate CaO distribution in both 2D and 3D. We also determined possible interrelations between laser-induced craters and bone structure units, which may reflect the bone structure and may influence the heterogeneity of CaO distributions. By using two different statistical methods, we could confirm if bone samples were homogeneous or not with respect to CaO concentration distribution. LIPS, a technique previously used in geology, may be included in bone research. Assessment of element oxide concentrations in the inorganic part of bone, as well as mathematical calculations may be useful to determine the content of CaO and other element oxides in bone, further analyze bone structure and homogeneity and possibly apply this research to normal, as well as diseased bones.},

Toluene is one of the most commonly used solvents in industry; it is easily available and conventient to use. Many toxicologic effects on biological systems secondary to deliberate inhalation of toluene have been reported, but investigations on adverse effects associated with bone morbidity is limited. The purpose of this study is to determine bone mineralization and investigate the adverse effects of toluene on bone. The bone mineral density and content of the femoral neck of mice exposed to toluene at 300 ppm for 8 wk were measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry and found significantly reduced compared to the control group. Chronic exposure to toluene was found to affect bone metabolism, and toluene-induced changes could contribute to bone resorption and inhibition of bone formation. Toluene seems to be the responsible component for the demineralizating effects of commonly abused substances, and medical doctors must promote their education about the health hazards in those who abuse solvents especially in areas where inhalant abuse is endemic.},

  abstract = {Evidence has accumulated to suggest that magnesium might play a role in controlling angiogenesis. Since microvascular endothelial cells are protagonists in this process, we investigated the behavior of these cells cultured in low extracellular magnesium or silenced for its transporter Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin (TRPM)7, essential for cellular magnesium homeostasis. In particular, we focused on some crucial steps of the angiogenic process, i.e. proliferation, migration, protease production and organization in tridimensional structures. Silencing TRPM7 mimics the effects of low extracellular magnesium on human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC). Indeed, while no effects were observed on the production of metalloproteases and on tridimensional organization on matrigel, both magnesium deficiency and silencing of TRPM7 impair cell migration and inhibit growth by arresting the cells in the G0/G1 and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Since low extracellular magnesium markedly decreases TRPM7 in HMEC, we suggest that TRPM7 downregulation might mediate low magnesium-induced inhibition of cell growth and migration. Human endothelial cells from the umbilical vein are growth inhibited by low magnesium and growth stimulated after TRPM7 silencing. An impairment of ERK phosphorylation in HMEC silencing TRPM7 is responsible, in part, for the different proliferative behavior of these two cell types. We broadened our studies also to endothelial colony-forming cells and found that they are sensitive to fluctuations of the concentrations of extracellular magnesium, while their proliferation rate is not modulated by TRPM7 silencing. Our results point to magnesium and TRPM7 as a modulators of the angiogenic phenotype of microvascular endothelial cells.},

  abstract = {The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is frequently responsible for chronic hyponatremia in the elderly due to age-related disruption of the inhibitory component of brain osmoregulatory mechanisms. Recent research has indicated that chronic hyponatremia is associated with gait disturbances, increased falls, and bone fragility in humans, and we have found that chronic hyponatremia causes increased bone resorption and reduced bone mineral density in young rats. In this study, we used a model of SIADH to study multi-organ consequences of chronic hyponatremia in aged rats. Sustained hyponatremia for 18~weeks caused progressive reduction of bone mineral density by DXA and decreased bone ash calcium, phosphate and sodium contents at the tibia and lumbar vertebrae. Administration of 10-fold higher vitamin D during the last 8~weeks of the study compensated for the reduction in bone formation and halted bone loss. Hyponatremic rats developed hypogonadism, as indicated by slightly lower serum testosterone and higher serum FSH and LH concentrations, markedly decreased testicular weight, and abnormal testicular histology. Aged hyponatremic rats also manifested decreased body fat, skeletal muscle sarcopenia by densitometry, and cardiomyopathy manifested as increased heart weight and perivascular and interstitial fibrosis by histology. These findings are consistent with recent results in cultured osteoclastic cells, indicating that low extracellular sodium concentrations increased oxidative stress, thereby potentially exacerbating multiple manifestations of senescence. Future prospective studies in patients with SIADH may indicate whether these multi-organ age-related comorbidities may potentially contribute to the observed increased incidence of fractures and mortality in this population.},

We investigated whether SrR influences the macro- and nanomechnical properties of healing fractures in rats. A closed tibia fracture model was used to study fracture healing in rats after 3 and 8~weeks of healing. Two groups of rats were treated with SrR (900~mg/kg/day) mixed into the food, while two groups served as control animals. The healing fractures were investigated by three-point bending, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and nanoindentation. There was a 100-fold increase (P~{$<~$}0.001) in serum Sr after 3 and 8~weeks of SrR treatment. The callus volume was significantly higher in the SrR-treated group than in control animals (P~{$<~$}0.01) after 3~weeks of healing. This was accompanied by a significant increase in callus bone mineral content (P~{$<~$}0.05). However, after 8~weeks of healing, no difference was found in either callus volume or bone mineral content. SrR did not influence maximum load or stiffness of the fractures after either 3 or 8~weeks of healing. EDX showed that Sr was incorporated into the callus; however, this did not influence the nanomechanical properties. In conclusion, SrR stimulates callus formation but has no effect on callus remodeling. Sr is incorporated into the newly formed callus tissue, but this has no deteriorating effect on the mechanical properties of rat tibial fractures at either the macroscopic or nanoscopic level after 3 or 8~weeks of healing.},

Also, several biochemical roles of Si in osteoblastic mineralization, the regulation of gene expression related to bone matrix synthesis, and the decrease in reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory mediators were reported, but these effects were mostly shown in cell culture studies. Hence, we tested the effect of Si supplementation on bone status and the gene expression related to bone metabolism and inflammatory mediators in young estrogen-deficient rats under calcium-replete condition (0.5~\% diet). Results showed that 15-week supplementation of both high and very high doses of Si (0.025 and 0.075~\% diet, respectively) could not restore the ovariectomy (OVX)-induced decrease of bone mineral density (BMD) of vertebrae, femur, and tibia. Also, several bone biochemical markers (ALP, osteocalcin, CTx) and mRNA expression of COL-I, RANKL, IL-6, and TNF-{$\alpha$} in femur metaphysis were not significantly changed by Si in OVX rats. However, a very high dose (0.075~\%) of Si supplementation significantly increased OPG expression and decreased the ratio of RANKL/OPG in mRNA expression comparable to that of sham-control animals. Taken together, Si supplementation did not increase BMD under calcium-replete condition but the decrease in the ratio of RANKL/OPG expression to the normal level suggests the possibility of a bone health benefit of Si in estrogen deficiency-induced bone loss.},

Boron may stimulate new bone formation and regeneration, when combined with nano-hydroxyapatite. We questioned whether injecting boron-containing nano-hydroxyapatite composites with hyaluronan increased the bone mineral density and new bone formation in osteoporotic rabbit femurs. The regenerative effects of injectable boron-containing nano-hydroxyapatite composites from 6 to 12 weeks, which may prevent osteoporotic femoral fractures, were assessed. Boron-containing (10 {$\mu$}g/ml) nano-hydroxyapatite composites were injected into the intramedullary femoral cavity with hyaluronan. These significantly increased the histomorphometric new bone surface to the total bone surface ratio at 6 and 9 weeks. The micro-tomographic bone volume to the total volume ratio and bone mineral density in osteoporotic rabbit femurs increased when compared to the hyaluronan (p = 0.004, p = 0.004, p = 0.004, p = 0.01, respectively) and the sham-control (p = 0.01, p = 0.004, p = 0.01, p = 0.037, respectively) groups. The boron-containing group had a higher bone mineralization and new bone formation compared to the nano-hydroxyapatite group, although the difference was not statistically significant. These findings reveal that intramedullary injection of boron-containing nano-hydroxyapatite with hyaluronan increases new bone formation and mineralization in ovariectomized rabbit femurs. Boron-containing nano-hydroxyapatite composites are promising tissue engineering biomaterials that may have regenerative potential in preventing primary and/or secondary femoral fractures in osteoporosis patients.},

Fifty-two Wistar rats (2~months old) were ovariectomized and distributed into two groups: control group (OVX-C) and NaF group (OVX-F), which was subjected to treatment with NaF (50~mg/L) administered in drinking water for 42~days. The chronic treatment with NaF promoted (1) a decrease in pp185 (IRS-1/IRS-2) tyrosine phosphorylation status after insulin infusion in white adipose tissue and in insulin sensitivity; (2) an increase in the plasma concentration of insulin, fluoride, osteocalcin, calcium, triglyceride, VLDL-cholesterol, TNF-{$\alpha$}, and IL-6; (3) a reduction in the trabecular width, bone area, stiffness, maximum strength, and tenacity; (4) no changes in body weight, food and water intake, plasma glucose, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, bone mineral content, and bone mineral density. It was concluded that chronic treatment with NaF (50~mg/L) in OVX rats causes a decrease in insulin sensitivity, insulin signaling transduction, and biochemical, biomechanical, and histomorphometric bone parameters.},

The bones were cleaned of soft tissue and femoral length and vertebral length were measured with a caliper and all bones were weighed on a precision scale. Final body weight (P {$<$} 0.05), TBBMC (P {$<$} 0.005), and femur weight (P {$<$} 0.005) were significantly lower in the control group. Femur length did not differ between groups, but the length of the 5th lumbar vertebra was greater in the control group (P {$<$} 0.05). Histomorphometry of the femur showed that Cn-BV/TV, Tb-N, Tb-Th were lower (P {$<$} 0.05 in all) and Tb-Sp was higher (P {$<$} 0.05) in the group given the lead-supplemented diet. These findings suggested lead-induced inhibition of axial bone development and a histomorphometric decrease in bone mass, produced mainly by enhanced resorption, and a densitometric increase in bone mass, produced by lead accumulation in bone.},

  abstract = {This prospective population-based cohort study investigated factors predicting distal forearm fracture (DFF) in perimenopausal women. The study population consisted of 11\,798 women from the Kuopio Osteoporosis Risk Factor and Prevention (OSTPRE) Study in Finland. Mean baseline age of these women was 52.3 (SD 2.9) years (range 47\textendash 56 years) and 68\% were postmenopausal. Three hundred and sixty-eight women (3.1\%) had a validated DFF during the 5-year follow-up. Previous wrist fracture, postmenopausal state, age and nulliparity were independent predictors of DFF, while hormone replacement therapy (HRT), dairy calcium and overweight protected against it in multivariate Cox regression analysis: previous wrist fracture increased the DFF risk by 158\% (p{$<$}0.0001), menopause by 69\% (p= 0.002) and age by 6\% per year (p= 0.010), whereas the continuous use of HRT decreased the risk by 63\% (p= 0.0001), the use of dairy calcium at 1000\textendash 1499 mg/day (vs {$<$}500 mg/day) by 39\% (p= 0.004), overweight (BMI {$>$}25 kg/m2) by 36\% (p= 0.0002) and parity by 29\% (p= 0.031). Combining dichotomous low weight, low use of calcium, non-use of HRT and previous wrist fracture into a risk score gave a dose\textendash response effect by score level: the presence (vs absence) of all four risk factors resulted in a 12-fold DFF risk. Nevertheless, the sensitivity and specificity of the score for detecting DFF remained low. It was concluded that HRT, high nutritional calcium intake and overweight protect against but a history of wrist fracture predisposes to perimenopausal distal forearm fracture. A simple risk factor inquiry would help to identify perimenopausal women at high risk of distal forearm fracture.},

Etiologies have included Crohn's disease, vascular complications, and the effects of radiation enteritis, as well as the effects of intestinal obstruction, dysmotility, or congenital defects.

The study focused on the Late Pleistocene ``beast solonetz'' sites (i.e. mineral licks/oases) of Western Siberia: Shestakovo-Kochegur (25.9\textendash 17.8~ka BP) in the Kemerovo region, Volchia Griva (17.8\textendash 11~ka BP) in the Novosibirsk region and Lugovskoye (16.5\textendash 10~ka BP) nearby Khanty-Mansiysk. Additional sites studies included sites (30\textendash 10~ka BP) from other regions of Northern Eurasia also with mass mammoth remains (Gari, Berelyokh, Krasnoyarskaya Kurya, Krak\'ow Spadzista Street, P\v{r}edmost\'i, Doln\'i V\v{e}stonice, Milovice and others). The results suggest that just at the end of the Pleistocene, large herbivorous mammals experienced a powerful geochemical stress which would manifest as mass destructive changes of bones due to enzootic diseases caused by mineral deficiency. Remains characterized by destructive changes are common and prevalent in all collections. Maximum damage was discovered in the bones and teeth of Mammuthus primigenius Blum. The most typical signs of osteodystrophy were osteoporosis, osteofibrosis, osteomalacia, osteolysis, cartilage atrophy, exostoses and fractures, resulting in the formation of false joints, ulcers and friction grooves on articular surfaces. The results of the paleoecological analysis suggest that the larger part of Northern Eurasia at the end of Pleistocene was extremely unfavourable for the existence of megafauna. The disruption of the abiotic relationships caused by the cardinal transformation of geochemical landscapes could have become the main reason for the wide-spread enzootia and, finally, the extinction of the mammoth.},

In the present study, we hypothesized that zinc could increase osteogenetic function by stimulating osteoblast proliferation and osteoprotegerin (OPG) activity. To test this hypothesis, osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured and treated with various concentrations of zinc (0, 10, 30, 50, 70, 110, 130, and 150~{$\mu$}M) for 24 and 48~h. 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-y]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay showed that cell proliferation was significantly stimulated with 50~{$\mu$}M zinc treatment. Furthermore, under the same treatment condition, OPG expression was significantly increased as evidenced by the results of RT-PCR and ELISA. However, the zinc-induced OPG expression was significantly attenuated when MC3T3-E1 cells were co-treated with either protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, GF109203X, or the Inhibitor of mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (MEK1), PD98059. Moreover, OPG expression was further increased when MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with PMA (the activator of protein of kinase C) in the presence of zinc. These results suggested that zinc would increase osteogenic function by stimulating PKC and MAPK signaling pathways.},

Oxidative stress may play a major role in the development of osteoporosis in part by inhibiting osteoblastic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs). Some evidence suggested that antioxidant selenium could prevent osteoporosis, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this work, the effect of sodium selenite on H2O2-induced inhibition of osteoblastic differentiation of primary rat bone MSCs and the related mechanisms were examined. Pretreatment with selenite inhibited the adverse effect of H2O2 on osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs, based on alkaline phosphatase activity, gene expression of type I collagen and osteocalcin, and matrix mineralization. In addition, selenite pretreatment also suppressed the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) induced by H2O2. The above effects were mediated by the antioxidant effect of selenite. Selenite enhanced the gene expression and activity of glutathione peroxidase, reversed the decreased total antioxidant capacity and reduced glutathione, and suppressed reactive oxygen species production and lipid peroxidation level in H2O2-treated MSCs. These results showed that selenite protected MSCs against H2O2-induced inhibition of osteoblastic differentiation through inhibiting oxidative stress and ERK activation, which provided, for the first time, the mechanistic explanation for the negative association of selenium status and risk of osteoporosis in terms of bone formation.},

Part of the acute phase response (APR) in these animals is the loss of trabecular bone at sites distant from the site of inflammation. To assess the possible involvement of vitamin D in the bone loss, we studied the development of the acute phase response in vitamin D-deprived rats. The serum APR provoked by subcutaneous inflammation in rachitic rats consisted of hypozincemia, hypercupremia, increased, alkaline phosphatase activity and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentration, and was similar to that in control animals except for the absence of hypoferremia. Control rats with talc-induced subcutaneous inflammation also had splenomegaly and decreased total and mononuclear peripheral blood cell counts, while subcutaneous inflammation did not induce spleen changes in rachitic rats. Subcutaneous inflammation induced the loss of trabecular bone and decreased the osteoblastic cell count in tibial metaphyses in control animals. Rachitic rats had abundant osteoid on trabecular surfaces, and the number of osteoblasts and osteoclasts was comparable to that of the controls. Subcutaneous inflammation did not affect any of the bone parameters in rachitic rats. These results indicate that vitamin D plays an important role in the generation of the acute phase response during inflammation, particularly in the induction of spleen and bone cell changes. The discrepancy of the blood on one hand and bone and spleen indices of the APR on the other, indicate that there may be divergent pathways in the generation of the inflammatory response, some of which may be dependent on vitamin D.},

  abstract = {Bone accretion during childhood is proportional to the rate of growth. During this time, interval height velocity is relatively slow for both boys and girls. As a direct consequence of this, calcium retention in the body of an average child is lower than the calcium retention in an adolescent. Bone size, bone mass, and bone mineral areal density of the regional skeletal sites increase on average by about 4\%/yr from childhood to late adolescence and young adulthood, when most of the bone mass is accumulated. Calcium needs are greater during adolescence (pubertal growth spurt) than in childhood or adulthood. According to calcium balance studies, the threshold in take for adolescents is about 1500 mg/d. Inadequate calcium intake during growth may increase the risk of childhood fractures and predispose certain individuals to a lower peak bone mass.},

The study population consisted of a number of male patients aged 56\textendash 77~years following hip replacement due to osteoarthritis of the hip. Bone specimens were taken from the femoral head and neck during arthroplasty. The elemental analyses were carried out using coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. The following DXA-HS parameters were assessed: buckling ratio (BR), cross-sectional area (CSA) and its moment of inertia (CSMI), section modulus, and Femoral Strength Index (FSI). Age was positively correlated with Na, K, and Cu in the bone. Ca in the bone was positively associated with BR and negatively with SM and CSMI. Of all the DXA-HS parameters, the weakest associations of elements in the bone were found with FSI and the strongest with BR. Among the elements in the serum, the strongest negative associations were found for K, Cr, Mn, and Zn with CSA, while the majority of bone elements were associated either positively (Ca, P, Mg, Zn, and Cu) or negatively (Mn, Fe, Pb, and Cr) with BR. In conclusion, the interactions between individual elements in blood serum and bone with DXA-HS could not be unequivocally established.},

Therefore, we investigated the pathogenic mechanism of human primary osteoblast proliferation and activation in relation to histone acetylation of the promoter p16, a well-known cell cycle regulation-related gene. The results showed that sodium fluoride (NaF) induced deacetylation and decreased expression of the p16 gene via inhibition of specificity protein 1 (Sp1) binding to its response element, which accounts for NaF increasing cell viability and promoting proliferation in human primary osteoblasts. These results reveal the regulatory mechanism of histone acetylation of the p16 gene on osteoblast activation in skeletal fluorosis.},

  abstract = {Objective: Several studies have suggested a compromised bone mass in phenylketonuria patients but most reported on heterogeneous or small patient groups. Our aim was to evaluate peak bone mass in adult PKU patients and to relate BMD to nutritional parameters. Patients and methods: BMD was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in 31 adult PKU patients (18 female), mean age 25 {$\pm$} 5.3 years. Nutritional intake was calculated based on food diaries. Diet adherence was determined based on patients' report. Results: Mean blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentration was 968 {$\pm$} 526 {$\mu$}mol/L (16 {$\pm$} 8.7 mg/dl). Eight patients (32.2\%) met the recommended blood Phe concentration of {$<$}726 {$\mu$}mol/L ({$<$}12 mg/dl), and there was no significant difference in Phe concentrations between diet-adherent and non-adherent patients. Osteopenia was detected in 11 patients (38.7\%), while osteoporosis was detected in 2 patients (6.5\%). No correlation was found between BMD and age, blood minerals, Phe, vitamin D and alkaline phosphatase levels, calcium and protein intake, body mass index, and body fat percentage. Conclusions: Peak bone mass is decreased in PKU patients. Possible explanations include long-standing dietary deficiency in protein, calcium, vitamin D or trace elements, or a primary defect in bone turnover inherent to the disease itself. Our data do not favour any of these hypotheses. Further studies are needed to elucidate the cause of low bone density in PKU patients.},

In this study, the antioxidant and therapeutic potential of this plant was investigated on cadmium (Cd)-induced hepatotoxicity. Rosa persica extract (RPE) was prepared by a maceration method in hydroalcoholic solvent, and its antioxidant properties were determined. Then, 36 mice were divided to six groups and treated for 2 weeks as follows: control, Cd (3 mg/kg), RPE (50 mg/kg), and groups 4\textendash 6 received Cd (3 mg/kg) and 12.5, 25, and 50 mg/kg of RPE respectively. The total polyphenol, flavonoids contents, and total antioxidant capacity in RPE were measured 263.4 {$\pm$} 7.2 mg rutin equivalent/g extract, 72.3 {$\pm$} 2.3 mg quercetin equivalent/g extract, and 8.46 {$\pm$} 0.27 {$\mu$}mol ferrous sulfate/g extract, respectively. The in vivo results showed that Cd elicited remarkable hepatic injury that was manifested by the significant increase in serum hepatic enzymes. In addition, Cd significantly increased the levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-{$\alpha$}) and decreased total thiol molecules (TTM) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in hepatic tissue. However, RPE decreased serum hepatic enzyme levels and improved oxidative hepatic damage by lowering the LPO and TNF-{$\alpha$} levels and raising TAC and TTM in in Cd-treated groups. Although the RPE increased the metallothionein (MT) protein content, there was no change in MT gene expression. The present study showed that the RPE due to having antioxidant properties might partially prevent hepatic oxidative damage by the improvement of oxidant/antioxidant balance in animals exposed to Cd.},

  abstract = {Background: The EC Concerted Action PASSCLAIM aims to produce a generic tool for assessing the scientific support for health-related claims for foods and food components. Aim: The task of the ITGB Working Group was to critically evaluate the categories of scientific evidence needed to support claims in relation to bone health and osteoporosis. Methods: A framework was developed to describe the chain of evidence that is required to link the consumption of a food or food component to bone health outcomes. Techniques available for interrogating each link in the chain were identified and their strengths and weaknesses considered. This framework was used to determine intermediate markers of health outcome with respect to osteoporosis and to debate the level of evidence that would be required to substantiate claims of enhanced function or reduced disease risk. Results: Use of this framework with osteoporotic fracture as the health endpoint resulted in the following judgements based on current knowledge: 1) bone mineral density (BMD) is an intermediate marker of bone health which, for people of any age and sex, can provide evidence of enhanced function; 2) for people over 50 years living in populations with a high incidence of fracture, BMD is an intermediate marker of osteoporotic fracture risk which can provide evidence of an increased probability of reduced disease risk; 3) because osteoporosis is defined as a state of increased fracture risk due to low bone mass and deterioration in bone microarchitecture, a claim of a definite reduction in osteoporosis or fracture risk requires similar substantiation to claims that fractures are prevented or treated, including clinical trials and animal studies; 4) data from lower in the chain of evidence, such as bone turnover and calcium bioavailability, are not, by themselves, sufficiently strongly related to bone health endpoints to provide evidence of enhanced function or reduced disease risk but can provide supporting information. Conclusions: In the light of existing scientific knowledge, a framework has been developed as a tool for considering the scientific support for claims relating to bone health and osteoporosis. To provide a working example, the framework has been used to assess the current position with osteoporotic fracture as the health endpoint.

Increases in bone mineral density observed after 1 year of treatment are predictive of the long-term fracture efficacy, suggesting for the first time in osteoporosis that bone densitometry can be used as a monitoring tool.

  abstract = {Osteoporosis and magnesium (Mg) deficiency often occur in malabsorption syndromes such as gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE). Mg deficiency is known to impair parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion and action in humans and will result in osteopenia and increased skeletal fragility in animal models. We hypothesize that Mg depletion may contribute to the osteoporosis associated with malabsorption. It was our objective to determine Mg status and bone mass in GSE patients who were clinically asymptomatic and on a stable gluten-free diet, as well as their response to Mg therapy. Twenty-three patients with biopsy-proven GSE on a gluten-free diet were assessed for Mg deficiency by determination of the serum Mg, red blood cell (RBC) and lymphocyte free Mg2+, and total lymphocyte Mg. Fourteen subjects completed a 3-month treatment period in which they were given 504-576 mg MgCl2 or Mg lactate daily. Serum PTH, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and osteocalcin were measured at baseline and monthly thereafter. Eight patients who had documented Mg depletion (RBC Mg2+{$<$}150 \textmu M) underwent bone density measurements of the lumbar spine and proximal femur, and 5 of these patients were followed for 2 years on Mg therapy. The mean serum Mg, calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase concentrations were in the normal range. Most serum calcium values fell below mean normal and the baseline serum PTH was high normal or slightly elevated in 7 of the 14 subjects who completed the 3-month treatment period. No correlation with the serum calcium was noted, however. Mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and osteocalcin concentrations were also normal. Despite only 1 patient having hypomagnesemia, the RBC Mg2+ (153{$\pm$}6.2 \textmu M; mean {$\pm$} SEM) and lymphocyte Mg2+ (182{$\pm$}5.5 \textmu M) were significantly lower than normal (202{$\pm$}6.0 \textmu M,p{$<$}0.001, and 198{$\pm$}6.8 \textmu M,p{$<$}0.05, respectively). Bone densitometry revealed that 4 of 8 patients had osteoporosis of the lumbar spine and 5 of 8 had osteoporosis of the proximal femur (T-scores {$\geq-$}2.5). Mg therapy resulted in a significant rise in the mean serum PTH concentration from 44.6{$\pm$}3.6 pg/ml to 55.9{$\pm$}5.6 pg/ml (p{$<$}0.05). In the 5 patients given Mg supplements for 2 years, a significant increased in bone mineral density was observed in the femoral neck and total proximal femur. This increase in bone mineral density correlated positively with a rise in RBC Mg2+. This study demonstrates that GSE patients have reduction in intracellular free Mg2+, despite being clinically asymptomatic on a gluten-free diet. Bone mass also appears to be reduced. Mg therapy resulted in a rise in PTH, suggesting that the intracellular Mg deficit was impairing PTH secretion in these patients. The increase in bone density in response to Mg therapy suggests that Mg depletion may be one factor contributing to osteoporosis in GSE.},

The aim of this study was to present data from the association of plasma zinc, copper and toxic elements of lead and cadmium levels with bone mineral density in Iranian women. 135 women gave their information and enrolled. Fasting plasma was used for measurement of trace elements and heavy metals by Differential Pulse Anodic Stripping Voltammetry. Control group (n = 51) were normal in both lumbar spine (L1-L4) and femoral neck density (T-score {$\geq$} -1), but just femoral neck T-score was considered as criterion in selection of patient group (n = 49, Tscore {$<$} -1). No differences were found in the nutritional status, number of diseases, drugs and functional activities between these groups. Plasma Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd levels were analyzed by, a method of voltammetry. Mean {$\pm$} SD levels of copper and zinc was 1.168 {$\pm$} 0.115, 1.097 {$\pm$} 0.091 {$\mu$}g/ml in control group, 1.394 {$\pm$} 0.133, 1.266 {$\pm$} 0.11 {$\mu$}g/ml in total patient (TP) and 1.237 {$\pm$} 0.182, 1.127 {$\pm$} 0.176 {$\mu$}g/ml in Mild patients(-1 {$>$} T-score {$>$} -1.7), 1.463 {$\pm$} 0.174, 1.327 {$\pm$} 0.147 {$\mu$}g/ml in Severe patient group (T-score {$<$} -1.7); respectively.

In this study plasma zinc, copper, lead \& cadmium concentrations were higher in the patients than in the control, though differences were not significant. However, differences were higher between the controls and patients with severe disease (T-score {$<$} -1.7). In addition adjusted T-score of femur with age and BMI showed negative significant correlation with plasma levels of zinc and lead in total participants (p {$<$} 0.05, r = -0.201, p = 0.044, r = -0.201). It seems that more extensive study with larger ample size might supply definite results about this association for copper and cadmium.},

We studied the mRNA expression of calcium-sensing receptor (CaR), vitamin D receptor (VDR) and calbindin D 9  ~k (D 9  ~k) by northern blot analysis in the duodenal mucosa of rats. Weanling pups fed with chow diet containing adequate calcium (0.5\% w/w) and drinking water (NaF {$<$} 1  ~ppm) served as controls (Group I) and were studied at 9 and 15 weeks. The pups, born to rats fed with a calcium-deficient diet (0.03\%) and excess fluoride water (NaF 50  ~ppm), were continued on the same diet and water (Group II) until 9 weeks of age. Subsequently, Group II rats were divided into 4 subgroups; 3 subgroups with fluoride free water [II-A adequate calcium, II-B excess calcium (Ca 2\%) and II-D calcium deficient], whereas II-C received fluorinated water and adequate calcium diet until 15 weeks. At 9 weeks, as compared to group-I, group-II had decreased VDR (P {$<$} 0.001) and D 9  ~k mRNA (P {$<$} 0.001), whereas CaR mRNA levels increased (P {$<$} 0.05). At 15 weeks, as compared to group-I, VDR mRNA further reduced in group II-D (P {$<$} 0.001) and II-C (P {$<$} 0.001), whereas it increased in group II-A. Removal of fluoride ingestion and calcium replenishment increased D 9  ~k mRNA expression, maximally in adequate calcium group (P {$<$} 0.001), while it was further reduced in group II-C (P {$<$} 0.001). CaR expression decreased significantly in all the groups. We conclude that excess fluoride reduces the mRNA levels of VDR and D 9  ~k in the duodenal mucosa of rats, thereby possibly reducing calcium absorption. Calcium supplementation with simultaneous fluoride removal improves their expression.},

Subjects and Methods: 18 female patients (age 48-79 y, BMI 23-43 kg/m2) had BMD measurements performed 25 years after JI bypass. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry was used, and measured sites were the lumbar spine L2-L4, left femoral neck and total hip. Vitamin and mineral supplementation had not routinely been prescribed. An assessment was made on age-adjusted BMD values, and as to whether present BMD was related to present demographic and biochemical variables. Results: No significant reduction of BMD was found beyond that which was expected for age. BMD was inversely and separately related to age and body weight. The serum level of vitamin D was low in 45\% of the patients, and inversely correlated to body weight and BMI. Alk phosphatase and parathyroid hormone were the best markers for low BMD. Conclusion: These results suggest that JI bypass has not been detrimental to bone density in females. We recommend, however, vitamin D and calcium supplements after malabsorptive procedures for morbid obesity.},

  abstract = {Bisphosphonates (BPs) are drugs widely used in the treatment of various bone diseases. BPs localize to bone mineral, and their concentration in resorption lacunae could reach almost milimolar levels. Bone alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a membrane-bound exoenzyme that has been implicated in bone formation and mineralization. In this study, we investigated the possible direct effect of three N-containing BPs (alendronate, pamidronate, and zoledronate) on the specific activity of bone ALP obtained from an extract of UMR106 rat osteosarcoma cells. Enzymatic activity was measured by spectrophotometric detection of p-nitrophenol product and by in situ visualization of ALP bands after an electrophoresis on cellulose acetate gels. Because ALP is a metalloprotein that contains Zn2+ and Mg2+, both of which are necessary for catalytic function, we also evaluated the participation of these divalent cations in the possible effect of BPs on enzymatic activity. All BPs tested were found to dose-dependently inhibit spectrophotometrically measured ALP activity (93\textendash 42\% of basal) at concentrations of BPs between 10-5M and 10-4M, the order of potency being zoledronate {$\approxeq$} alendronate {$>$} pamidronate. However, coincubation with excess Zn2+ or Mg2+ completely abolished this inhibitory effect. Electrophoretic analysis rendered very similar results: namely a decrease in the enzymatic activity of the bone-ALP band by BPs and a reversion of this inhibition by divalent cations. This study shows that N-containing BPs directly inhibit bone-ALP activity, in a concentration range to which this exoenzyme is probably exposed in vivo. In addition, this inhibitory effect is most possibly the result of the chelation of Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions by BPs.},

  abstract = {During mechanical~unloading, endothelial cells reduce osteogenesis and increase bone resorption. Here we describe the feedback response of endothelial cells to unloaded osteoblasts. Primary endothelial cells, ex vivo mouse aortic rings and chicken egg yolk membranes were incubated with conditioned medium from mouse primary osteoblasts (OB-CM) subjected to unit gravity or simulated microgravity, to assess its effect on angiogenesis. In vivo injection of botulin toxin A (Botox) in the quadriceps and calf muscles of C57BL/6J mice was performed to mimic disuse osteoporosis. Unloaded osteoblasts showed strong upregulation of the pro-angiogenic factor, VEGF, and their conditioned medium increased in vitro endothelial cell viability, Cyclin D1 expression, migration and tube formation, ex vivo endothelial cell sprouting from aortic rings, and in ovo angiogenesis. Treatment with the VEGF blocker, avastin, prevented unloaded OB-CM-mediated in vitro and ex vivo enhancement of angiogenesis. Bone mechanical unloading by Botox treatment, known to reduce bone mass, prompted the overexpression of VEGF in osteoblasts. The cross talk between osteoblasts and endothelial cells plays a pathophysiologic role in the response of the endothelium to unloading during disuse osteoporosis. In this context, VEGF represents a prominent osteoblast factor stimulating angiogenesis.},

  abstract = {Cadmium exposure may increase the risk of osteoporosis. However, there is no quick method to get bone mineral density (BMD) unless dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) examinations were performed. In the present study, we aimed to identify associated factors to osteoporosis and fracture in a Chinese female population with cadmium exposure and develop nomograms to predict the risk. A total of 488 women was included in this study. Cadmium in blood (BCd) and urine (UCd) were determined as exposure biomarkers. BMD was determined using single-photon absorptiometry. Urinary N-acetyl-{$\beta$}-d-glucosaminidase (UNAG) and urinary albumin (UALB) were determined as renal function biomarkers. Osteoporosis was defined if T-score\,{$<$}\,-\,2.5. Multiple logistic regression showed that age, BCd, and menopausal status were independent risk factors for osteoporosis. The odds (OR) value was 1.19 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.14\textendash 1.25) for age, 1.05 (95\% CI: 1.004\textendash 1.10) for BCd, and 4.75 (95\% CI: 1.65\textendash 13.69) for menopausal status after adjusting with cofounders. Age and UCd were the independent risk factors for bone fracture. Nomograms were developed based on the associated factors. Age was the main determinant for osteoporosis or fracture. Receiver operating curve showed acceptable performance in predicting osteoporosis (area under the curve (AUC)\,=\,0.93, 95CI: 0.90\textendash 0.96) and fracture (AUC\,=\,0.67, 95\% CI: 0.58\textendash 0.75). Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) further showed that 88.9\% of osteoporosis and 68.4\% of fractures were correctly classified. Our study develops nomograms that may be used to predict cadmium-induced osteoporosis or fracture if BMD data is not available.},
