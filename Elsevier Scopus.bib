  abstract = {Various bone abnormalities, including osteoporosis, have been associated with chronic arsenic and cadmium exposure in experimental animal models, but information regarding the bone pathology of wild population of small mammals breeding in contaminated environment is limited. This present study was conducted to comparatively assess the prevalence and pattern of skeletal abnormalities in free ranging snowshoe hares inhabiting an area heavily contaminated by arsenic and other trace metals, near the vicinity of the abandoned Giant mine, and in a reference location approximately 20 km from the city of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada. The femur and vertebrae of snowshoe hares from the mine area and reference location were subjected to bone densitometry examination and biomechanical testing using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and 3-point bending test. t-test results indicated that femoral densitometry parameters such as bone mineral density (BMD) (p = 0.5), bone mineral content (BMC) (p = 0.675), bone area (BA) (p = 0.978) and tissue area (TA) (p = 0.549) were not significantly different between locations. All densitometry parameters of the vertebrae (BMD, BA and TA) differed between locations (p \textexclamdown{} 0.05), except for BMC (p = 0.951) which showed no significant difference between the two locations. Vertebrae from the mine area also showed relatively lower BA and TA compared to the reference location. A constellation of skeletal abnormalities were also observed along the axial and appendicular bones respectively. Specifically, growth defects, osteoporosis, cortical fractures, sclerosis, and cyst like changes were commonly observed in the femurs and vertebrae of hares from both locations. With respect to biomechanical properties, only bone stiffness and peak load tended to be relatively reduced in specimens from the mine area, whereas work to failure was notably increased in specimens from the reference site compared to those from the mine area. Taken together, the results of this preliminary study suggest that chronic concomitant exposure to arsenic and cadmium may be involved in the etiology of various bone abnormalities, including osteoporosis in wild population of snowshoe hares from the Yellowknife area. The result presented in this study represent the first evaluation of osteological effects in free-ranging furbearers (snowshoe hares) diagnosed with arsenicosis, and concomitantly exposed to environmental levels of cadmium. \textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {In patients diagnosed with osteoporosis, calcium is lost from bones making them weaker and easily susceptible to fractures. Supplementation of calcium is highly recommended for such conditions. However, the source of calcium plays an important role in the amount of calcium that is assimilated into bone. We hypothesize that naturally occurring coral calcium and zeolite may prevent ovariectomy-induced bone loss. We have measured bone loss in ovariectomized mice supplemented with coral calcium and Zeolite. Female C57BL/6 mice were either sham-operated or ovariectomized and fed diets containing coral calcium or zeolite for 6 months. Serum was analyzed for bone biochemical markers and cytokines. Bones were analyzed using dual x-ray absorbtiometry, peripheral quantitative computed tomography, and micro-computed tomography densitometry. In the distal femoral metaphysis, total bone and cortical bone mass was restored and the endocortical surface was significantly decreased in coral calcium and zeolite fed ovariectomized (OVX) mice. Trabecular number and the ratio of bone volume to total volume was higher in OVX mice after coral calcium and zeolite feeding, while trabecular separation decreased in the different treatment OVX groups. Coral calcium protected bone to a lesser extent in the proximal tibia and lumbar vertebrae. Overall, coral calcium and zeolite may protect postmenopausal bone loss. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Material and methods. A multicenter comparative open trial of vitrum osteomag influence on mineral bone density (MBD), change of pain syndrome in bones, index of calcium-phosphorous metabolism covered 334 postmenopausal women with osteopenia. MBD was measured in low-back spine and proximal part of the hip with DEXA method. All the patients were divided into 3 groups: 125 women taking 2 tablets of vitrum osteomag daily for 12 months (group 1); 111 women taking 1500 mg calcium carbonate (group 2); 96 women - control group (only observation). Results. Vitrum osteomag relieved pain in the back and joints, had a positive effect on bone density (+1.5\%) and proximal parts of the hip (0.6-0.93\%) exceeding the effect of calcium carbonate only which preserves the initial MBD in low back spine but does not prevent bone loss in the hip. MBD dynamics in patients given vitrum osteomag differs essentially from one in the control group (from -1.9 to -2.91\%) which demonstrates a reliable preventive anti-osteoporotic effect of this medication. The drug increases the level of general and ionized calcium in blood but does not cause hypercalcemia lowering the level of parathormone in blood. The rate of side effects in group 1 was 14, 4\% and did not differ much from that in group 2 (16.2\%). Conclusion. The results of the study allow to recommend vitrum osteomag for prophylaxis of a rapid loss of bone tissue mineral density.},

  abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a primarily digestive systemic disease triggered and maintained by the ingestion of gluten in the diet. Its has a wide clinical spectrum of manifestations, particularly varied in adult patients, in whom, because of their frequent negative serology and mild, nonspecific symptoms, there is a considerable delay in diagnosis. The intestinal lesion caused by CD leads to various deficiencies of nutrients, vitamins, and dietary minerals, with ferropenia, vitamin B12, folic acid, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies being especially frequent. The deficiencies, together with dairy intolerance, cause low bone density and an increased risk of fractures. Treatment using a gluten-free diet (GFD) does involve certain complications, since gluten is found in up to 70\% of manufactured food products and manufacturing regulations are not standard in all countries. In addition, certain nutrient deficiencies require specific management. This article reviews the nutritional aspects of CD and provides practical guidelines to correct these deficiencies and to ensure optimum GFD compliance. \textcopyright{} 2011 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.},

Individuals with compromised bone strength were educated about skeletal health issues and provided with therapeutic options for potential amelioration of their bone health. Patients who declined pharmacotherapy or who previously experienced failure of drug treatment were offered other options including supplemental micronutrients identified in the medical literature as sometimes having a positive impact on bone mineral density (BMD). After 12 months of consecutive supplemental micronutrient therapy with a combination that included vitamin D3, vitamin K2, strontium, magnesium and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), repeat bone densitometry was performed. The results were analyzed in a group of compliant patients and demonstrate improved BMD in patients classified with normal, osteopenic and osteoporotic bone density. According to the results, this combined micronutrient supplementation regimen appears to be at least as effective as bisphosphonates or strontium ranelate in raising BMD levels in hip, spine, and femoral neck sites. No fractures occurred in the group taking the micronutrient protocol. This micronutrient regimen also appears to show efficacy in individuals where bisphosphonate therapy was previously unsuccessful in maintaining or raising BMD. Prospective clinical trials are required to confirm efficacy. \textcopyright{} 2012 Stephen J. Genuis and Thomas P. Bouchard.},

The distribution of mineral particles in a given bone (mineralization profile) has been studied using density fractionation as well as microradiography and electron backscattering imaging. The biological determinant of mineralization is the rate of turnover. During rapid growth and periods of high remodeling, mineralization is shifted towards lower mineral density (hypomineralization). During aging and periods of low remodeling, mineralization is shifted towards higher mineral densities (hypermineralization). Chemicals can also influence the mineralization profile of bone. Fluoride induces hypermineralization by stabilizing the apatite lattice and reducing bone mineral solubility, whereas strontium induces hypomineralization by loosening the apatite lattice and increasing bone mineral solubility. Drugs such as bisphosphonates induce hypermineralization by inhibiting resorption and acting as crystal poison. Finally, mineralization can be impaired by defects as in rickets and osteomalacia or made excessive by continuous accretion of mineral without resorption as in osteopetrosis. \textcopyright{} 1993 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.},

We assessed the association between nutrient patterns and BMD among an ageing Australian population. Methods Participants (n = 1135; males, 45.8\%; median age, 62.0 years) with dietary and BMD data in the North West Adelaide Health Study (NWAHS) were included. Dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. BMD was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Nutrient patterns were identified by factor analysis. Linear regression analyses were conducted to assess the association between nutrient patterns and BMD (mg/cm 2 ). Multiple imputation and sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate the effect of missing data on the estimates. Results Three nutrient patterns (mixed-source [potassium, calcium, fibre, retinol and Vitamin B 12 ], animal-sourced [cholesterol, protein, Vitamin B 12 and fat] and plant-sourced [fibre, carotene, vitamin C and Lutein]) were identified. After adjusting for socio-demographic, lifestyle and behavioural characteristics, chronic conditions and energy intake, animal ({$\beta$} = -4.07; 95\% confidence interval (CI): -11.89, 3.76) and plant-sourced ({$\beta$} = -0.99; 95\% CI: -7.43, 5.45) patterns were not associated with BMD. However, we found that the mixed-source pattern was positively associated with BMD ({$\beta$} = 10.86; 95\% CI: 1.91, 19.80). We did not find interactions between the pattern, other covariates and BMD. The multiple imputation and sensitivity analyses including missing data identified similar patterns of association between nutrient patterns and BMD. Conclusions Whereas animal- and plant-sourced nutrient patterns are not associated with BMD, mixed-source pattern may have benefit in prevention of reduced BMD. \textcopyright{} 2017 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism},

The presence of multifactorial pathogenesis that results from inflammation is associated with low micronutrient consumption and glucocorticoid use, which may be related to bone health. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between dietary mineral intake and glucocorticoid use in bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with CD. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 62 patients with CD ages 20 y to 40 y measured their macro- and micronutrient intake with a 3-d food record. The lumbar spine and femoral neck BMDs were determined using a bone densitometry technique. The C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) values were also noted. Results: Dietary intake of calcium, zinc, and magnesium was below the reference values but the phosphorus intake level was within the normal value range. Patients with osteopenia and osteoporosis accounted for 17.7\% and 14.5\%, respectively, of the total number of participants. Significant bone loss was found in 22.6\% of patients taking glucocorticoid medications. BMD was significantly reduced and also observed in patients in the active phase of their disease. Zinc and calcium intakes were found to be correlated with reduced femoral neck BMD. The mean CRP and ESR values were above the normal ranges. Significant differences in age and ESR were observed between patients with normal and reduced BMD (P \textexclamdown{} 0.05). Conclusions: Low calcium and zinc intake, glucocorticoid use, and active disease phase are favorable conditions for bone loss in patients with Crohn's disease. \textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

However, there are still no precise indications regarding a possible role of silicon on bone health in humans. Given this background, the aim of this narrative review was to consider the effectiveness of silicon dietary intake and silicon dietary supplementation (alone or with other micronutrients), in order to suggest a daily dosage of Si supplementation, on bone mineral density in humans. This review included eight eligible studies: four regarding dietary intake and four considering supplementation with silicon alone or with other nutrients. Despite the number of studies considered being low, the number of subjects studied is high (10012) and the results are interesting. Although to date the available scientific evidences are not considered valid enough to allow to establish an adequate level of Silicon intake, based on extrapolations from the data obtained with studies on animal and human models, it has been suggested that an adequate intake in order to promote beneficial effects for bone could be considered to be around 25 mg silicon/day. As for silicon dietary supplements, it has been shown that the combined treatment with orthosilicic acid (6 mg), calcium, and vitamin D has a potentially beneficial effect on femoral BMD compared to only use of calcium and vitamin D. \textcopyright{} 2021 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.},

Meanwhile, micro-CT and biomechanical analysis were carried out to ensure the success of the osteoporosis model and to validate the anti-osteoporosis effect of raw and salt-processed AB. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was employed to screen potential biomarkers and the MetaboAnalyst and KEGG PATHWAY Database were used to investigate the metabolic pathway. Results: Raw and salt-processed AB protected the rats against osteoporosis, as evidenced by the restoration of the alkaline phosphatase activity, osteocalcin concentration, urine calcium/creatinine ratio and urine phosphorus/creatinine ratio. The combination of PCA and PLS-DA revealed deviations in ninety-four differential biomarkers between raw AB treated group and model group. The identified biomarkers were primarily engaged in the metabolic pathways including galactose metabolism, urea cycle, arginine and proline metabolism, alanine metabolism, lactose degradation, ammonia recycling and glycine and serine metabolism. The levels of these biomarkers showed significant alterations and a tendency to be restored to normal values in raw and salt-processed AB treated osteoporosis rats. Of note, the levels of trace elements, such as Zn, Se, Mn, Cu and Fe, were elevated after raw and salt-processed AB treatment. Finally, a correlation network diagram was constructed to show the biomarkers perturbed by raw and salt-processed AB. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that raw and salt-processed AB has positive effects on osteoporosis rats. Meanwhile, metabolomic and metallomic method coupled with metabolites enrichment analysis and pattern recognition serves as a useful tool for revealing the action mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine. \textcopyright{} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Calcium supplements are broadly prescribed to treat osteoporosis either as monotherapy or together with vitamin D to enhance calcium absorption. It is still unclear whether calcium supplementation significantly contributes to the reduction of bone fragility and fracture risk. Data suggest that supplementing post-menopausal women with high doses of calcium has a detrimental impact on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are prone to vascular calcification in part due to impaired phosphate excretion. Calcium-based phosphate binders further increase risk of vascular calcification progression. In both bone and vascular tissue, vitamin K-dependent processes play an important role in calcium homeostasis and it is tempting to speculate that vitamin K supplementation might protect from the potentially untoward effects of calcium supplementation. This review provides an update on current literature on calcium supplementation among post-menopausal women and CKD patients and discusses underlying molecular mechanisms of vascular calcification. We propose therapeutic strategies with vitamin K2 treatment to prevent or hold progression of vascular calcification as a consequence of excessive calcium intake. \textcopyright{} Copyright \textcopyright{} 2019 Wasilewski, Vervloet and Schurgers.},

  abstract = {We report a case of clinically significant micronutrient deficiencies following biliary pancreatic diversion (BPD) surgery. Our patient was admitted to hospital six years after BPD surgery following a low impact humeral fracture complicated by postoperative wound infection. On presentation she complained of a widespread rash and loss of night vision. Laboratory testing confirmed hypoalbuminaemia, deficiencies of vitamins A, E and D and of the trace elements copper, zinc and selenium. Bone densitometry confirmed osteoporosis. The skin rash was thought to be due to zinc deficiency and improved with conservative measures and trace element replacement. Her night blindness resolved 48 hours after receiving high dose parenteral vitamin A. Six months later she was readmitted to our intensive care unit with wound dehiscence at her fracture site and clinical features of sepsis and encephalopathy. This case highlights the importance of devising treatment and follow-up guidance prior to surgery and multidisciplinary team involvement including the patient so that long-term metabolic complications are avoided. \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.},

  abstract = {Introduction: in addition to genetic predisposition, a significant exogenous factor in the formation of Undifferentiated connective tissue dysplasia (UDCTD) is the deficiency of osteotropic micronutrients such as vitamins (D, A, C, E, K); macroelements (calcium, phosphorus, magnesium), trace elements (copper, manganese, zinc, boron, selenium, silicon), so essential for the connective tissue matrix and, above all, for bone tissue. A small number of studies of osteotropic micronutrients and the state of bone tissue in adolescents with UDCTD served as the basis for this comprehensive study. Materials: a randomized study of 130 adolescents aged 10\textendash 16 years in the 1\textendash 2 health groups. The first group (primary) was 90 subjects with detected UDCTD. The second group (comparative) was 40 people with no signs of dysplasia. Methods: included the definition of: vitamin D \textendash{} 25(OH)D: micronutrients; calcium ductation: spinal column densitometry at LII \textendash LIV level; physical development and psycho-emotional stress levels. Availability disorders of 25(OH)D, low calcium consumption, magnesium deficiency, and shifts in micronutrient content correlated with densitometric data showing a 75\% decrease BMD in Group 1 adolescents, while in Group 2 only 27.5\%. The results of a comprehensive study showed that osteotropic micronutrient deficiency is a serious exogenous trigger for the development and progression of UDCTD with osteopenia/osteoporosis formation. Osteopenia/ osteoporosis, low physical development, disorders in the psycho-emotional sphere indicate the seriousness of the prognosis of UDCTD in adolescents. \textcopyright{} 2020, Remedium Group Ltd.
