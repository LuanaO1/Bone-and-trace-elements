  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is a systemic bone disease which leads to a reduction in bone mass. Many studies have shown that up to 80\% of bone mineral density (BMD) variations are attributed to genetic factors. Arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase enzyme, encoded by the ALOX12 gene, produces lipid peroxides as reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to oxidative stress and the development of osteoporosis. Selenium (Se) is incorporated into selenoproteins, which may reduce the risk of osteoporosis. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the association of 2 ALOX12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and serum Se level with lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD among elderly individuals living in Amirkola, Iran. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study consisted of 180 individuals aged {$\geq$}60 years (90 healthy and 90 osteoporotic patients). We examined the effect of 2 ALOX12 SNPs (rs2292350 and rs9897850), using the polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) on both BMD regions measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Serum Se level was measured using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer PGG990 AAS (PG Instruments Ltd., Luterworth, USA). RESULTS: The rs2292350 SNP showed a significant association with femoral neck BMD (p = 0.04). Moreover, in terms of serum Se level, a significant difference was found between the patient group (57.58 {$\pm$}25.54 {$\mu$}g/L) and the control group (81.09 {$\pm$}25.58 {$\mu$}g/L) (p {$<$} 0.001). In addition, individuals with higher serum Se levels also had higher BMD of the lumbar spine (r2 = 0.392; p {$<$} 0.001) and the femoral neck (r2 = 0.478; p {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that genetic variation in ALOX12 might influence BMD variations in our recruited participants. As for the patients with lower serum Se levels, it was observed that serum Se deficiency was accompanied by some ALOX12 variation, contributing to the development of osteoporosis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Life style and physical activity play a pivotal role in prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. The mechanism for better bone metabolism and improvement of physical disorders is not clear yet. Trace minerals such as Ca, Mn, Cu, and Zn are essential precursors for most vital biological process, especially those of bone health. OBJECTIVE: The main target of this study was evaluating the effective role of supervised aerobic exercise for 1 hour/day, 3 days/week for 12 weeks in the functions of trace elements in bone health through measuring bone mineral density (BMD), osteoporosis (T-score), bone markers, and trace element concentrations in healthy subjects aged 30-60 years with age average of 41.2{$\pm$}4.9. METHODS: A total of 100 healthy subjects (47 males, 53 females; age range 30-60 years) were recruited for this study. Based on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan analysis, the participants were classified into three groups: normal (n=30), osteopenic (n=40), and osteoporotic (n=30). Following, 12 weeks of moderate aerobic exercise, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), BMD, T-score, and trace elements such as Ca, Mn, Cu, and Zn were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. RESULTS: Significant improvement in serum BAP level, T-score, and BMD were observed in all participants following 12 weeks of moderate exercise. Participants with osteopenia and osteoporosis showed significant increase in serum Ca and Mn, along with decrease in serum Cu and Zn levels following 12 weeks of aerobic training. In control group, the improvements in serum trace elements and body mass index were significantly linked with the enhancement in the levels of BAP, BMD hip, and BMD spine. These results supported the preventive effects of moderate exercise in healthy subjects against osteoporosis. In both sexes, the changes in serum trace elements significantly correlated (P{$<$}0.05) with the improvement in BAP, BMD hip, BMD spine, and body mass index in all groups. CONCLUSION: The observed changes in the levels of Ca, Mn, Cu, and Zn were shown to be positively correlated with improved bone mass density among control and osteoporosis subjects of both sexes. These results demonstrate that aerobic exercise of moderate intensity might protect bone and cartilage by regulation of body trace elements which are involved in the biosynthesis of bone matrix structures and inhibition of bone resorption process via a proposed anti-free radical mechanism.},

The main parameters of mineral metabolism, together with biochemical markers of bone resorption (urinary N-telopeptides of type I collagen) and formation (serum bone isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase and serum osteocalcin) were evaluated. In the same subjects lumbar spine and femoral bone mineral density (BMD) were also measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. All patients but the younger 26-year-old patient had lower than normal bone mass at femoral neck and total hip, showing marked osteopenia in three cases and osteoporosis in the remaining three cases. However, at lumbar spine BMD measurement provided spuriously overestimated results, because of intervertebral disc calcification and osteophyte formation. As far as biochemical markers of bone turnover are concerned, the most relevant finding was the increased N-telopeptides of type I collagen urinary excretion. Our results suggest that ochronosis may be associated with increased bone resorption rate leading to an accelerated bone loss. A role of the homogentisic acid polymer deposit in bone matrix and cells, possibly with osteocyte damage and interference in collagen metabolism, might be hypothesized.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Postmenopausal osteoporosis is a frequent cause of morbidity and can negatively impact life expectancy; iodine is an essential element for bone mineralization, and iodine deficiency is frequently observed. The aim of the present study was to understand the connection between postmenopausal osteoporosis and the level of iodine in the body. METHODS: A total of 132 participants were divided into three groups: group 1 consisted of healthy postmenopausal women (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}34), group 2 comprised osteopenic women (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}38), and group 3 included women with postmenopausal osteoporosis (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}60). The three groups were compared according to demographic, clinical, and laboratory findings. RESULTS: The urinary iodine levels were recorded as 216.1{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}125.2 in the control group, 154.6{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}76.6 in the osteopenic group, and 137.5{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}64.9 in the postmenopausal osteoporosis group (P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.001). These differences were maintained after adjustment for body mass index (P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.001). The urinary iodine level accurately correlated with the total T-score for the lumbar spine (r{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.236, P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.008). Multiple regression analysis showed that corrected for body mass index, alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme, and urinary deoxypyridinoline, the urinary iodine level was significantly associated with total T-score (beta coefficient{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.270, P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The urinary iodine level was significantly lower in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, and iodine replacement may be important in preventing osteoporosis in areas where iodine deficiency is endemic.},

Supplementation of calcium is highly recommended for such conditions. However, the source of calcium plays an important role in the amount of calcium that is assimilated into bone. We hypothesize that naturally occurring coral calcium and zeolite may prevent ovariectomy-induced bone loss. We have measured bone loss in ovariectomized mice supplemented with coral calcium and Zeolite. Female C57BL/6 mice were either sham-operated or ovariectomized and fed diets containing coral calcium or zeolite for 6 months. Serum was analyzed for bone biochemical markers and cytokines. Bones were analyzed using dual x-ray absorbtiometry, peripheral quantitative computed tomography, and micro-computed tomography densitometry. In the distal femoral metaphysis, total bone and cortical bone mass was restored and the endocortical surface was significantly decreased in coral calcium and zeolite fed ovariectomized (OVX) mice. Trabecular number and the ratio of bone volume to total volume was higher in OVX mice after coral calcium and zeolite feeding, while trabecular separation decreased in the different treatment OVX groups. Coral calcium protected bone to a lesser extent in the proximal tibia and lumbar vertebrae. Overall, coral calcium and zeolite may protect postmenopausal bone loss.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A multicenter comparative open trial of vitrum osteomag influence on mineral bone density (MBD), change of pain syndrome in bones, index of calcium-phosphorous metabolism covered 334 postmenopausal women with osteopenia. MBD was measured in low-back spine and proximal part of the hip with DEXA method. All the patients were divided into 3 groups: 125 women taking 2 tablets of vitrum osteomag daily for 12 months (group 1); 111 women taking 1500 mg calcium carbonate (group 2); 96 women--control group (only observation). RESULTS: Vitrum osteomag relieved pain in the back and joints, had a positive effect on bone density (+1.5\%) and proximal parts of the hip (0.6-0.93\%) exceeding the effect of calcium carbonate only which preserves the initial MBD in low back spine but does not prevent bone loss in the hip. MBD dynamics in patients given vitrum osteomag differs essentially from one in the control group (from -1.9 to -2.91\%) which demonstrates a reliable preventive anti-osteoporotic effect of this medication. The drug increases the level of general and ionized calcium in blood but does not cause hypercalcemia lowering the level of parathormone in blood. The rate of side effects in group 1 was 14.4\% and did not differ much from that in group 2 (16.2\%). CONCLUSION: The results of the study allow to recommend vitrum osteomag for prophylaxis of a rapid loss of bone tissue mineral density.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis to evaluate effects on biochemical markers and urinary excretion of zinc (Zn) of calcitonin therapy. METHODS: Patients were required to have a bone mineral density (BMD) of 2.5 S.D. or more below the young adult mean either at the postero-anterior lumbar spine or at the femoral neck. Subjects were eligible for our study if they were 50 years or older, with at least 5 years of menopause, and in good general health as determined by medical history and a routine clinical blood analysis. The patients were randomly assigned to receive intranasal salmon calcitonin (200 IU/day; 50 patients) or placebo (50 patients). All patients received supplemental calcium (1000 mg/day). Additionally, 40 age-matched, demographically similar, healthy postmenopausal women were also selected as controls. Measurements of cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (uNTx), osteocalcin (sOC), and urinary zinc concentration were done. All parameters were measured before therapy and again after 1, 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: After 3 and 6 months of treatment, a higher decrease of most indices was observed in the calcitonin group. A statistically significant decrease occurred in the levels of sOC, uNTx and uZn after 3 and 6 months in patients receiving calcitonin therapy (P{$<$}0.05). Levels of sOC and uNTx in calcitonin group were significantly different after 3 and 6 months from both placebo and baseline values of calcitonin group (P{$<$}0.05). Levels of sOC, uNTx and uZn decreased about 40, 46 and 37\%, respectively, in calcitonin group at 6 months after the start of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that values of uNTx, uZn and sOC were significantly lower in the patient group than those in control group and in postmenopausal women with osteopororsis, calcitonin reduces the concentrations of uNTx, uZn and sOC.},

An analysis of variance (ANOVA) test also showed that vitamin A was negatively associated with the LS BMD (F = 6.143; p = 0.013, but without significance when a multivariate analysis was applied. The a-DAQS did not have an association with BMD; however, Vitamin A showed a negative correlation with BMD, but such an association disappeared when the other antioxidants were taken together. Our findings encourage an antioxidant-based dietary approach to osteoporosis prevention and treatment, since the negative effect of vitamin A was neutralized by the intake of such nutrients.},

Ninety-two patients attending our diabetes service (56 females/36 males) with diabetes mellitus type 2 were enrolled in a consecutive way. The inclusion criteria were diabetes diagnosed {$>$}40 years of age, with type 2 diabetes defined in accordance with the criteria of the American Diabetes Association and no use of dietary supplements. Body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, glucose level, and HbA1c levels were assessed in all patients. X-ray densitometry of the calcaneal region and a 3-days written food record keeping, and a qualitative questionnaire of lifestyle were also performed. RESULTS: A total of 21.7\% of patients had osteoporosis (T score {$<$}2.5 SD). Patients were overweight with a high BMI and a medium glucose control. Patients with osteoporosis were older than those without osteoporosis (67.8 +/- 6.9 vs. 62.1 +/- 9.2 years; p {$<$} 0.05). Significant differences were detected between patients without and with osteoporosis in calcium intake (1,219.37 +/- 387 vs. 839 +/- 251 mg/day; p {$<$} 0.05) and zinc intake (9.23 +/- 3.5 vs. 13.3 +/- 6.9 mg/day; p {$<$} 0.05), respectively.

In univariate analysis with dicotomic variables, only exercise was positive associated with osteoporotic status (87.5\% exercise habit in patients without osteoporosis and 25\% exercise habit in patients with osteoporosis; p {$<$} 0.05). In a logistic model with the dependent variable (osteoporosis), remained in the final model dietary dairy intake of calcium and zinc, BMI, age and exercise.

This follow-up study included 204 residents living in the vicinity of a closed copper refinery, who had been found to have elevated urinary or blood Cd levels. Cd levels in the blood and urine, as well as BMD, were measured every 6 months. After the first BMD measurement, individuals were prescribed antiresorptives such as alendronate or vitamin D and calcium, according to their BMD. Subjects were classified according to the type of medicine provided over the previous 6 months. General linear models controlling for other factors were used to evaluate the effects of each type of medication on the participants' Cd levels and BMD. Spinal BMD showed a significant increase in the antiresorptive group compared to the nontreatment group. Significant decreases in blood Cd levels were found in the vitamin D and calcium group, in comparison to the nontreatment group, as well as a marginally significant decrease in the antiresorptive group. The vitamin D and calcium group showed a significantly greater decrease in urinary Cd levels than the nontreatment group. In contrast, antiresorptive medication was found to have a negative effect on urinary Cd excretion. These results suggest that vitamin D and calcium treatment for osteoporosis lowers blood Cd levels more effectively and improves urinary Cd excretion.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of low bone mineral density (BMD) in a prospective series of adult celiac patients and to identify nutritional and metabolic factors associated with osteoporosis and osteopenia. METHODS: Patients over 18 years of age who were consecutively and newly diagnosed with celiac disease (CD) were recruited. A bone density scan with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was carried out on the left hip and lumbar spine; nutritional parameters were analyzed and a hormone study conducted in order to exclude secondary low BMD. RESULTS: 40 patients (36 females/4 males) between the ages of 18 and 68 (mean 44.25 years) were recruited. Overall, at the moment of diagnosis 45\% of patients exhibited low BMD at both demarcations. Risk of hip fracture was generally low, but ascended to mild in patients with villous atrophy (p = 0.011). Differences in major fracture risk were also observed depending on Marsh stage (p = 0.015). Significant differences were observed in nutritional status between patients with and without duodenal villous atrophy, with body mass index and blood levels of prealbumin, iron, vitamin D and folic acid significantly lower in Marsh III stage patients. No differences were found in blood hormone levels between Marsh stages or BMDs. The degree of bone mass loss in the lumbar spine directly correlated to Marsh stage. In the hip, a parallel association between BMD and Marsh stage was also observed, but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Duodenal villous atrophy, through malabsorption, was the main determinant factor for low BMD in adult-onset CD patients.},

DESIGN: A cross sectional study examining correlations between BMD (Duel-energy X ray absorptiometry; (DXA) and dietary intake (3-day diaries), body composition and plasma bone and inflammatory markers: C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) and procollagen type I N propeptide (P1NP), C- reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 and 10 (IL-6, IL-10), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and osteoprotegerin (OPG). SETTING: Community dwelling women from the Auckland, Hawke's Bay and Manawatu regions in New Zealand. PARTICIPANTS: 142 healthy, PM women aged 50-70 years. RESULTS: OPG (per kilogram fat mass) was increased in women with osteoporosis (p{$<$}0.001) compared to groups classified with normal BMD and osteopenia. Protein, vitamin B12, zinc, potassium and dairy intake were all positively correlated with higher BMD while dairy and potassium intakes also inversely correlated with CTX. Body composition (weight, BMI and fat/lean mass) had strong positive associations with BMD. Multiple regression analysis showed body weight, potassium and dairy intake were predictors of increased BMD in PM women and explained 39\% (r2=0.39, p{$<$} 0.003) of variance. CONCLUSION: BMD was negatively correlated with OPG and positively with weight, dairy and potassium intake. This study highlights the importance of maintaining adequate body weight and emphasising dairy and potassium predominantly sourced from fruit/vegetables to reduce bone loss at midlife.},

  abstract = {Using the dental panoramic tomogram (DPT) and a nickel stepwedge, the prevalence of mandibular osteoporosis in 99 elderly, edentulous individuals was investigated densitometrically. A site was chosen on each DPT adjacent to the mandibular mental foramen and the optical density measured using a digital densitometer. Each DPT was then independently examined by a radiologist and the patients grouped into those exhibiting osteoporosis and those not. Twenty-seven of the patients exhibited qualitative evidence of osteoporosis on the DPT, using established radiological criteria. A large majority of this group was female (25 individuals, 93 per cent). Of the remaining 72 non-osteoporotic patients, only 32 (44 per cent) were female. There was a significant difference in the quantitative, densitometrically derived measurements of mandibular bone density between the osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic groups. The osteoporotic group had a mean optical density at the mandibular measurement site (mean D = -0.773, s.d. = 0.2) which was significantly different from that of the non-osteoporotic group (mean D = -0.888, s.d. = 0.21), t = 2.432, P less than 0.02. This previously diagnosed difference supports the validity of the densitometric technique. When all 99 patients were studied, the difference between the mean mandibular, equivalent nickel thickness of the males and females was significant (t = 2.32, P = 0.022). This sex difference could not be entirely accounted for by differences in the period of edentulousness or age of males and females.},

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the independent association between dietary zinc and plasma zinc and the association of each with bone mineral density (BMD) and 4-y bone loss in community-dwelling older men. DESIGN: Of the original Rancho Bernardo Study subjects, 396 men (age: 45-92 y) completed BMD measurements at baseline in 1988-1992 and 4 y later. Osteoporosis was defined as a BMD {$>$} or = 2.5 SDs below the mean for young women (a T-score {$<$} or = -2.5). At baseline, dietary intake data were collected by using a standard food-frequency questionnaire, and plasma zinc concentrations were measured by using inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy. RESULTS: The mean dietary zinc intake was 11.2 mg, and the mean plasma zinc concentration was 12.7 micromol/L. Plasma zinc was correlated with total zinc intake (diet plus supplements). Dietary zinc intake and plasma zinc concentrations were lower in men with osteoporosis at the hip and spine than in men without osteoporosis at those locations. BMDs for the hip, spine, and distal wrist were significantly lower in men in the lowest plasma zinc quartile ({$<$}11.3 micromol/L) than in men with higher plasma zinc concentrations. The association between plasma zinc and BMD was cross-sectional, longitudinal, and independent of age or body mass index. However, plasma zinc did not predict bone loss during the 4-y interval. CONCLUSION: Dietary zinc intake and plasma zinc each have a positive association with BMD in men.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This study examined the role of trace elements in osteoporosis by comparing the trace-element concentrations in bone and the radiographic bone density and bone mineral density (BMD) of patients with osteoporotic femur fractures and osteoarthritis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study enrolled 30 patients operated on for proximal femoral fractures after falls, and another 30 patients undergoing hip arthroplasty at the same center for hip osteoarthritis. Bone samples were obtained during the surgical procedures. The density of the bone samples was assessed using computed tomography and the Hounsfield scale. The levels of Ca(II), Mg(II), and other trace elements in the bone samples were determined using flame atomic absorption spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. In addition, BMD, Z-scores, and T-scores were measured in the unaffected hips of all patients using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Magnesium (1,908 {$\pm$} 507 versus 2,540 {$\pm$} 435, P{$<$}0.05), calcium (10.4 {$\pm$} 3.5 versus 13.9 {$\pm$} 3.7, P{$<$}0.05), and zinc (2,342 {$\pm$} 1,252 versus 3,145 {$\pm$} 1,604, P{$<$}0.05) {$\mu$}g g(-1), levels were significantly lower in the bone samples in the fracture group. The groups did not differ in the other biochemical parameters. All dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry findings were significantly worse in the fracture group than in the osteoarthritis group. However, the groups did not differ in femoral neck density assessed radiologically using the Hounsfield scale. The following parameters were negatively correlated with age: magnesium, r=-0.436, P{$<$}0.001; calcium, r=-0.331, P=0.01; T-score, r=-0.381, P=0.003; Z-score, r=-0.267, P=0.043; and BMD, r=-0.365, P=0.004. CONCLUSION: Ca(II), Mg(II), and Zn(II) appear to play important roles in bone breakdown/synthesis. Further studies of the roles of trace elements in the etiology and treatment of osteoporosis are warranted. We found decreased bone levels of Ca, Mg, and Zn in patients with osteoporotic fractures compared to subjects with osteoarthritis.},

  abstract = {Osteoporosis is a common metabolic bone disease. The impact of global blood plasma proteins on the risk of osteoporosis remains elusive now. We performed a large-scale polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis to evaluate the potential effects of blood plasma proteins on the development of osteoporosis in 2286 Caucasians, including 558 males and 1728 females. Bone mineral density (BMD) and bone areas at ulna \& radius, hip, and spine were measured using Hologic 4500W DXA. BMD/bone areas values were adjusted for age, sex, height, and weight as covariates. Genome-wide SNP genotyping of 2286 Caucasian subjects was performed using Affymetrix Human SNP Array 6.0. The 267 blood plasma proteins-associated SNP loci and their genetic effects were obtained from recently published genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a highly multiplexed aptamer-based affinity proteomics platform. The polygenetic risk score (PRS) of study subjects for each blood plasma protein was calculated from the genotypes data of the 2286 Caucasian subjects by PLINK software. Pearson correlation analysis of individual PRS values and BMD/bone area value was performed using R. Additionally, gender-specific analysis also was performed by Pearson correlation analysis. 267 blood plasma proteins were analyzed in this study. For BMD, we observed association signals between 41 proteins and BMD, mainly including whole body total BMD versus Factor H (p value\,=\,9.00\,\texttimes\,10-3), whole body total BMD versus BGH3 (p value\,=\,1.40\,\texttimes\,10-2), spine total BMD versus IGF-I (p value\,=\,2.15\,\texttimes\,10-2), and spine total BMD versus SAP (p value\,=\,3.90\,\texttimes\,10-2). As for bone areas, association evidence was observed between 45 blood plasma proteins and bone areas, such as ferritin versus spine area (p value\,=\,1.90\,\texttimes\,10-2), C4 versus hip area (p value\,=\,1.25\,\texttimes\,10-2), and hemoglobin versus right ulna and radius area (p value\,=\,2.70\,\texttimes\,10-2). Our study results suggest the modest impact of blood plasma proteins on the variations of BMD/bone areas, and identify several candidate blood plasma proteins for osteoporosis.},

Objective: To explore the relationship between blood metabolites and osteoporosis. Design and Methods: We used 2286 unrelated white subjects for the discovery samples and 3143 unrelated white subjects from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) for the replication samples. The bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was performed using Affymetrix Human SNP Array 6.0 (for discovery samples) and Affymetrix SNP 500K and 50K array (for FHS replication samples). The SNP sets significantly associated with blood metabolites were obtained from a reported whole-genome sequencing study. For each subject, the genetic risk score of the metabolite was calculated from the genotype data of the metabolite-associated SNP sets. Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the potential effect of blood metabolites on the variations in bone phenotypes; 10,000 permutations were conducted to calculate the empirical P value and false discovery rate. Results: We analyzed 481 blood metabolites. We identified multiple blood metabolites associated with hip BMD, such as 1,5-anhydroglucitol (Pdiscovery {$<$} 0.0001; Preplication = 0.0361), inosine (Pdiscovery = 0.0018; Preplication = 0.0256), theophylline (Pdiscovery = 0.0048; Preplication = 0.0433, gamma-glutamyl methionine (Pdiscovery = 0.0047; Preplication = 0.0471), 1-linoleoyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPC (18:2/20:4n6; Pdiscovery = 0.0018; Preplication = 0.0390), and X-12127 (Pdiscovery = 0.0002; Preplication = 0.0249).

After the epidemiological investigation of 290 postmenopausal women from ages 45 to 65 in the Xi'an urban area, their blood was collected and serum concentrations of macro-elements, calcium, phosphonium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, and trace elements, zinc, iron, copper, and selenium were determined using atomic absorption spectrometry. Their BMD was measured by QDR-2000 dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The correlation analysis between BMD and serum element contents was done with the software of SPSS 13.0. The correlation analysis of serum elements of postmenopausal women showed that there was a significant correlation between serum calcium and the other elements, and also a significant correlation between serum phosphonium and the others except serum potassium. The serum potassium content had a significant correlation with serum calcium, sodium and iron, but sodium content showed a significant correlation with the others except iron and selenium. In addition, copper had a significant correlation with the others except potassium and selenium. In correlation analysis between BMD and the elements contents, only did the potassium content show a significant positive correlation with BMD of lumbar vertebra and proximal femora. The comparison results between osteoporosis group, osteopenia group, and healthy group showed that there was no significant difference in the element contents between the groups, but there existed a tendency that potassium content increased with the rise of BMD. There exist significant correlations between the contents of serum elements such as calcium, phosphonium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, zinc, iron, copper, and selenium, but no significant differences in these elements contents between the osteoporosis group, osteopenia group, and healthy group. Serum potassium content shows a significant positive correlation with BMD, suggesting potassium may be involved in the development of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.},

Mean concentrations of magnesium and zinc were significantly lower in osteoporotic women than in both osteopenic women and normal women. In addition, magnesium and zinc concentrations in osteopenic women were significantly lower than in normal women. There were no statistically significant differences observed between the osteopenic, osteoporotic and control groups with respect to copper levels. The clinical significance of these changes needs further elucidation, but trace element supplementation, especially with magnesium and zinc and perhaps copper, may have beneficial effects on bone density.},

Healthy women aged 51-80 years were recruited for a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Women with similar femoral neck T scores and BMI were randomly assigned to two groups of 112 each that were supplemented daily for 2 years with 600~mg Ca plus maize starch placebo or 600~mg Ca plus 2~mg Cu and 12~mg Zn.

Repeated-measures ANCOVA showed that bone mineral contents, densities and T scores decreased from baseline values to year 2. A priori contrasts between baseline and year 2 indicated that the greatest decreases occurred with Cu and Zn supplementation. Based on 5~d food diaries, the negative effect was caused by Zn and mainly occurred with Zn intakes {$\geq~$}8{$\cdot$}0~mg/d. With Zn intakes {$<~$}8{$\cdot$}0~mg/d, Zn supplementation apparently prevented a significant decrease in whole-body bone densities and T scores. Food diaries also indicated that Mg intakes {$<~$}237~mg/d, Cu intakes {$<~$}0{$\cdot$}9~mg/d and Zn intakes {$<~$}8{$\cdot$}0~mg/d are associated with poorer bone health.

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 728 postmenopausal women were included in this study. Women were separated into two groups according to presence or absence of osteoporosis (OP). BMD was measured in total femur (TF), femoral neck (FN) and lumbar spine (L1-L4) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Risk factors for OP were recorded by using a structured questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Women's blood were collected and serum concentrations of iron, copper, zinc, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, ionized calcium, inorganic phosphorus were measured. RESULTS: Low serum copper levels were significantly associated with OP according to BMD values for TF, FN and L1-L4. There was a significant relationship between low serum zinc levels and OP for L1-L4 spines. Low iron serum levels were also significantly associated with OP in BMD measurements of TF. Low serum magnesium levels had significant association with OP of L1-L4 spines and TF. Serum levels of calcium, ionized calcium, potassium, sodium and inorganic phosphorus were not associated with OP. CONCLUSIONS: In postmenopausal women, the low serum levels of copper, zinc, iron and magnesium appear to be an important risk factor for OP.},

One of the experimental group consisting of 15 OVX rats was fed a diet supplemented with 500 mg of Si per kg of feed (Si + OVX).

The Si + OVX rats did not show a loss of bone mass induced by OVX at axial level (5th lumbar vertebra) or periphery (femur). Nonetheless, a significant increase (ANOVA with Bonferroni/Dunn post hocs test) of longitudinal development of the femur (P {$<$} 0.0001) was patent. These results, obtained through the measurements of axial and peripheral bones, warrant closer scrutiny in connection with the Si inhibitory effect on bone mass loss as well as the stimulatory effect on bone formation. Both actions, namely, inhibition of resorption and stimulation of formation, infer that Si may have a potential therapeutic application in the treatment of involutive osteoporosis.},

The intake of antioxidants may influence Bone Mineral Density by acting as free radical scavengers, preventing oxidation-induced damage to bone cells. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the association between the Dietary Antioxidant Quality Score and bone mineral density in a sample of healthy women. METHODS: A total of 280 women were grouped into three major groups: women aged {$\leq$} 35 years; women aged 36-45, and finally women aged {$>$}45 years. Calcaneous Bone Mineral Density (g/cm{$^2$}) was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Data on the eating habits of each participant were collected with a structured 24-hour diet recall questionnaire. A Dietary Antioxidant Quality Score was used to calculate antioxidant-nutrient intake. RESULTS: A significant and positive association was observed among Bone Mineral Density and dietary intake of vitamin C and selenium. Zinc intake was significantly related to Bone Mineral Density in the youngest group. Low antioxidant consumers were considered individuals whose Dietary Antioxidant Quality Score was lower or equal than the median (3.5), and high antioxidant consumers were those whose Dietary Antioxidant Quality Score were higher than 3.5. Bone Mineral Density was higher in the participants defined as high antioxidant consumers in all aged groups. CONCLUSION: The study showed that there is an association between Bone Mineral Density and the Dietary Antioxidant Quality Score in all the women studied. Therefore, new therapies for osteoporosis based on higher dietary antioxidant intakes might be developed basing on the results obtained in this study.},

Enamel biopsies obtained from 50 subjects aged 47.5 {$\pm$} 5 years showed decreased copper content, which was associated with reduced spine bone mineral density, suggesting deficits of this trace element contributing to bone demineralization, enamel attrition, and deteriorated quality of mineralized tissues. INTRODUCTION: The objective of this cross-sectional study was to assess associations between enamel trace minerals and bone mineral density (BMD) in severe tooth wear. We hypothesized that similar factors contributed to both the excessive abrasion of dental enamel and reduced BMD in subjects with tooth wear. METHODS: Fifty patients aged 47.5 {$\pm$} 5 years with severe tooth wear and 20 age-, sex-, and body mass index (BMI)-matched healthy volunteers with normal dental status were studied regarding dietary intakes of trace elements, serum and salivary copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and calcium (Ca) concentrations, and serum PTH, osteocalcin, and hydroxyvitamin D levels. Tooth wear was determined using clinical examination based on standard protocol according to Smith and Knight. In all subjects, acid biopsies of the maxillary central incisors were carried out to assess mineral composition of the enamel. Atomic absorption spectroscopy with an air/acetylene flame was used to measure Ca and Zn, and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy was used to analyze Cu content. BMD was examined using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Tooth wear patients had reduced lumbar spine, but not femoral, BMD relative to controls (p {$<$} 0.001). No differences were found in enamel Ca concentration and Zn content was slightly higher in tooth wear patients than in controls whereas Cu content was significantly decreased in the patients: 19.59 {$\pm$} 16.4 vs 36.86 {$\pm$} 26.1 {$\mu$}g/l (p = 0.01) despite similar levels of Cu in serum and saliva. The differences were independent of serum 25-OH-D, osteocalcin concentrations or PTH either. CONCLUSION: Severe tooth wear is associated with reduced spinal BMD. Enamel in adult individuals with severe tooth wear is low in copper content. Therefore, further work is needed to determine whether copper plays a role in bone pathophysiology in these patients.},

We attempted to analyze the relationship between the bone mineral density ([BMD] measured by dual-photon absorptiometry) and auxanologic parameters, degree of siderosis, function of the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)/IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP3) axis, calcium-phosphate balance, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and cytokines (interleukin-1beta [IL-1] and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha]) in 30 prepubertal children with beta-thalassemia major and 15 age-matched children with constitutional short stature (CSS), who have normal glucose tolerance and thyroid function. Children with beta-thalassemia had a significantly decreased BMD and mean BMD\% for age and sex (0.75+/-0.24 g/cm2 and 71\%+/-10\%, respectively) versus children with CSS (1.06+/-0.3 g/cm2 and 92\%+/-7\%, respectively). Thalassemic patients had significantly lower circulating concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP3 (49+/-21 ng/mL and 1.2+/-0.25 mg/L, respectively) compared with control children (153+/-42 ng/mL and 2.1+/-0.37 mg/L, respectively). The GH response to provocation by clonidine and glucagon was defective (peak GH {$<$} 7 microg/L) in 12 of the 30 thalassemic children. Serum concentrations of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha did not differ among the two study groups. Hypocalcemia was detected in five of the 30 thalassemic patients: hypoparathyroidism was diagnosed in two of the five and rickets in the other three. BMD was highly correlated with the circulating concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP3, as well as with the auxanologic parameters (age, weight, height, height standard deviation score [HSDS], and body mass index [BMI]). It is suggested that increasing the circulating IGF-I concentration through aggressive nutritional therapy and/or GH/IGF-I therapy with supplementation with vitamin D and/or calcium might improve bone growth and mineralization and prevent the development of osteoporosis and consequent fractures in these patients. Such therapy requires blinded controlled trials.},

METHODS: Data for analyses were collected from a population based cross-sectional study performed at the Xiangya Hospital Health Management Centre. Dietary Se intake was evaluated using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. OP was diagnosed on the basis of bone mineral density scans using a compact radiographic absorptiometry system. The correlation between dietary Se intake and the prevalence of OP was primarily examined by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: This cross-sectional study included a total of 6267 subjects (mean age: 52.2\,{$\pm$}\,7.4\,years; 42\% women), and the prevalence of OP among the included subjects was 9.6\% (2.3\% in men and 19.7\% in women). Compared with the lowest quartile, the energy intake, age, gender and body mass index (BMI)-adjusted odds ratios of OP were 0.72 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-0.94), 0.72 (95\% CI 0.51-1.01) and 0.47 (95\% CI 0.31-0.73) for the second, third and fourth quartiles of dietary Se intake, respectively (P for trend\,=\,0.001). The results remained consistent in male and female subjects. Adjustment for additional potential confounders (i.e., smoking status, drinking status, physical activity level, nutritional supplements, diabetes, hypertension, fibre intake, and calcium intake) did not cause substantial changes to the results.

The aim of this study was to describe nutrient intake, nutritional status and nutrition-related complications in a Danish population of outpatients with alcohol dependency. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with a 6-month follow-up enrolling persons with alcohol dependency (n = 80) admitted to a hospital-based outpatient clinic. Body mass index, the waist-to-hip ratio and handgrip strength (HGS) were measured, a 7-day food diary was collected, and biochemical testing was conducted. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was performed to determine body composition and bone mineral density (BMD). RESULTS: In total, 64\% of the patients with alcohol dependency had vitamin D insufficiency (25-OH-vit D {$<$}50 nmol/l). Compared with surveys of the general population, the patients with alcohol dependency had lower energy intake (p = 0.008), s-zinc levels (p {$<$} 0.001), s-magnesium levels (p = 0.02), Z-scores for BMD (lumbar spine, p = 0.03; total hip, p = 0.009) and HGS (p {$<$} 0.001). Osteopenia was observed in 52\% of individuals, and overt osteoporosis was noted in 7\%. Comparing baseline data with data from the follow-up (n = 30), we found a decrease in s-CRP (p = 0.002) and s-alanine amino transferase (p = 0.01) levels and an increase in s-parathyroid hormone levels (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with alcohol dependency have an altered nutritional status and risk of complications, as evidenced by osteopenia/osteoporosis and reduced muscle strength. Treatment at an outpatient clinic improved the variables related to liver function, but no change was observed in nutritional status over time. These findings suggest that specific screening and targeted treatment regimens for nutritional deficits could be beneficial.},

  abstract = {We report a case of clinically significant micronutrient deficiencies following biliary pancreatic diversion (BPD) surgery. Our patient was admitted to hospital six years after BPD surgery following a low impact humeral fracture complicated by postoperative wound infection. On presentation she complained of a widespread rash and loss of night vision. Laboratory testing confirmed hypoalbuminaemia, deficiencies of vitamins A, E and D and of the trace elements copper, zinc and selenium. Bone densitometry confirmed osteoporosis. The skin rash was thought to be due to zinc deficiency and improved with conservative measures and trace element replacement. Her night blindness resolved 48 hours after receiving high dose parenteral vitamin A. Six months later she was readmitted to our intensive care unit with wound dehiscence at her fracture site and clinical features of sepsis and encephalopathy. This case highlights the importance of devising treatment and follow-up guidance prior to surgery and multidisciplinary team involvement including the patient so that long-term metabolic complications are avoided.},

  abstract = {Osteoporosis is reported to be common among Saudi women. Several minerals appear to be important determinants of insulin-like growth factor (IGF), the bioactivity of which regulates bone and mineral metabolism. Here we proposed that mineral status may alter the IGF system among individuals with osteoporosis. This study aims to evaluate the relationships between essential elements and IGF levels among postmenopausal Saudi women with osteoporosis. A total of 128 postmenopausal Saudi women aged {$\geq$}50 years old were recruited in this study. Diagnosis of osteoporosis was done by using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry to determine the bone minerals density (BMD). Serum calcium and phosphate were determined using routine chemical analyzer. Serum Co, Mn, Ni, Cd were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Serum IGF-1 and IGF-2 were determined using Luminex xMAP. Using stepwise linear regression analysis, only Cd was identified to be significantly associated with IGF1 in osteoporosis, explaining 3\% (confidence interval 0.01-0.05; P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0001) of the variance perceived. Our results suggest that Cd exposure indirectly affects BMD which may increase the risk of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Further longitudinal study using a larger sample size is recommended to determine causality of Cd levels and IGF-1.},

  abstract = {Childhood systemic diseases are commonly treated with steroids. Consequently, steroid-induced osteoporosis is often observed as a side effect of steroid therapy. However, osteoporosis of tibia resulting from steroid therapy has not been reported yet. Herein we constructed a steroid-induced osteoporosis in tibia of the growing phase rats to examine internal structural changes of the bone and tried to find out the effect of bisphosphonates as a new and early treatment method. Biomechanical analysis was performed using two-dimensional microdensitometry and three-dimensional pQCT method. In addition, the following evaluations were carried out: noninvasive bone strength measurements in steroid-induced osteoporotic rat tibiae; comparing the effectiveness of single high-calcium diet versus combined treatment of high calcium and bisphosphonate for osteoporosis; and quantitative measurement of four elements (Ca, P, Mg, Zn) in bone matrix. Our data suggested that a combined treatment of high calcium and bisphosphonate was an effective new method to improve and treat steroid-induced osteoporosis in childhood.},
