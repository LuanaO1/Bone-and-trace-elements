  abstract = {Bone mineral density, a bone matrix parameter frequently used to predict fracture risk, is not the only one to affect bone fragility. Other factors, including the  extracellular matrix (ECM) composition and microarchitecture, are of paramount  relevance in this process. The bone ECM is a noncellular three-dimensional structure  secreted by cells into the extracellular space, which comprises inorganic and  organic compounds. The main inorganic components of the ECM are calcium-deficient  apatite and trace elements, while the organic ECM consists of collagen type I and  noncollagenous proteins. Bone ECM dynamically interacts with osteoblasts and  osteoclasts to regulate the formation of new bone during regeneration. Thus, the  composition and structure of inorganic and organic bone matrix may directly affect  bone quality. Moreover, proteins that compose ECM, beyond their structural role have  other crucial biological functions, thanks to their ability to bind multiple  interacting partners like other ECM proteins, growth factors, signal receptors and  adhesion molecules. Thus, ECM proteins provide a complex network of biochemical and  physiological signals. Herein, we summarize different ECM factors that are essential  to bone strength besides, discussing how these parameters are altered in  pathological conditions related with bone fragility.},

  abstract = {Iron overload due to hemochromatosis or chronic blood transfusions has been associated with the development of osteoporosis. However, the impact of changes in  iron homeostasis on osteoblast functions and the underlying mechanisms are poorly  defined. Since Wnt signaling is a critical regulator of bone remodeling, we aimed to  analyze the effects of iron overload and iron deficiency on osteoblast function, and  further define the role of Wnt signaling in these processes. Therefore, bone marrow  stromal cells were isolated from wild-type mice and differentiated towards  osteoblasts. Exposure of the cells to iron dose-dependently attenuated osteoblast  differentiation in terms of mineralization and osteogenic gene expression, whereas  iron chelation with deferoxamine promoted osteogenic differentiation in a time- and  dose-dependent manner up to 3-fold. Similar results were obtained for human bone  marrow stromal cells. To elucidate whether the pro-osteogenic effect of deferoxamine  is mediated via Wnt signaling, we performed a Wnt profiler array of  deferoxamine-treated osteoblasts. Wnt5a was amongst the most highly induced genes.  Further analysis revealed a time- and dose-dependent induction of Wnt5a being  up-regulated 2-fold after 48 h at 50 {$\mu$}M deferoxamine. Pathway analysis using  specific inhibitors revealed that deferoxamine utilized the  phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and nuclear factor of activated T cell pathways to  induce Wnt5a expression. Finally, we confirmed the requirement of Wnt5a in the  deferoxamine-mediated osteoblast-promoting effects by analyzing the matrix  mineralization of Wnt5a-deficient cells. The promoting effect of deferoxamine on  matrix mineralization in wild-type cells was completely abolished in Wnt5a(-/-)  cells. Thus, these data demonstrate that Wnt5a is critical for the pro-osteogenic  effects of iron chelation using deferoxamine.},

  abstract = {The search for new strategies for the prevention and control of osteoporosis is an urgent task. Functional foodstuffs and their components are of particular interest  in this regard. The aim was to study the effect of bread enriched with protein,  dietary fiber, calcium, iron and iodine on the state of the bone tissue of rats in a  model of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Material and methods. The experiment was  performed on sexually mature female Wistar rats divided into groups: K - control  (sham-operated rats, not ovariectomized); \cyrchar\CYRO (30) - osteoporosis model (animals were  sacrificed 30 days after ovariectomy); groups \cyrchar\CYRO (120) and \cyrchar\CYRO (120+) - a model of  osteoporosis (rats were sacrificed 120 days after ovariectomy). All animals were fed  a standard vivary diet. For rats of the \cyrchar\CYRO (120+) group, from the 40th to the 120th  day, enriched bread was included in the diet in an amount of 6 g per 100 g of body  weight per day. The bread was fortified with protein (whey protein, blood plasma  proteins from farm animals), dietary fiber, calcium (eggshell), iron (purified  hemoglobin) and iodized whey protein. Animals of groups K and \cyrchar\CYRO (120) received  unfortified bread in the same amount. Blood levels of total calcium (by colorimetric  method), gonadotropins, testosterone, and estradiol (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay) were analyzed. Microtomographic evaluation of the architecture and mineral  density of the trabecular part of the femur and lumbar vertebrae was performed.  Histomorphological analysis of the uterus and femur of animals was performed.  Results and discussion. In animals of the \cyrchar\CYRO (120+) group, in comparison with the  \cyrchar\CYRO (120) sample, there was a decrease in blood testosterone and a marked compensatory  release of follicle-stimulating hormone, while no changes were detected in the  concentration of estradiol and the state of the uterus atrophied against the  background of ovariectomy. There was an increase in the trabecular mineral density  of the femur and lumbar vertebrae. The proportion of bone trabeculae in the total  volume of the femoral metaphysis (BV/TV) in animals of the \cyrchar\CYRO (120+) sample was  12.5{$\pm$}0.66\% compared to 10.4{$\pm$}0.52\% in the \cyrchar\CYRO (120) group. The values of the structural  model index (SMI) reflecting the loss of bone strength and the trabecularity  coefficient (TbPf) in \cyrchar\CYRO (120+) rats (1.44{$\pm$}0.07 and 5.96{$\pm$}0.29 1/mm) were significantly  lower than these parameters in the \cyrchar\CYRO (120) group (1.74{$\pm$}0.08; 9.13{$\pm$}0.46 1/mm, \cyrchar\cyrr{$<$}0.05).  The micro-architectural structure of the femur in the \cyrchar\CYRO (120+) group of rats was  close to that of the \cyrchar\CYRO (30) sample, which serves as a model of the early stage of  osteoporosis (SMI 1.42{$\pm$}0.07; TbPf 5.55{$\pm$}0.28 1/mm). The percentage of bone resorption  perimeter and the number of osteoclasts in the \cyrchar\CYRO (120+) femoral trabeculae were lower  than in the \cyrchar\CYRO (120) group. In the \cyrchar\CYRO (120+) group, active osteoblasts were observed in  a significant part of the resorption cavities. Cell differentiation more was  observed in the osteogenic direction than in the adipogenic direction. Conclusion.  Bread enriched with protein, fiber, calcium, iron and iodine, effectively weakens  osteoporosis induced by ovariectomy in rats. Its inclusion in the diet may be  beneficial for the prevention and treatment of systemic postmenopausal osteoporosis.},

The preparation of SiHA with lower temperature methods (about 700\textdegree C)  provides nanocrystalline SiHA (nano-SiHA) with enhanced bioreactivity due to higher  surface area and smaller crystal size. The aim of this study has been to know the  nanocrystallinity effects on the response of both osteoblasts and osteoclasts (the  two main cell types involved in bone remodelling) to silicon substituted  hydroxyapatite. EXPERIMENTS: Saos-2 osteoblasts and osteoclast-like cells  (differentiated from RAW-264.7 macrophages) have been cultured on the surface of  nano-SiHA and SiHA disks and different cell parameters have been evaluated: cell  adhesion, proliferation, viability, intracellular content of reactive oxygen  species, cell cycle phases, apoptosis, cell morphology, osteoclast-like cell  differentiation and resorptive activity. FINDINGS: This comparative in vitro study  evidences that nanocrystallinity of SiHA affects the cell/biomaterial interface  inducing bone cell apoptosis by loss of cell anchorage (anoikis), delaying  osteoclast-like cell differentiation and decreasing the resorptive activity of this  cell type. These results suggest the potential use of nano-SiHA biomaterial for  preventing bone resorption in treatment of osteoporotic bone.},

  abstract = {Silicon-substituted hydroxyapatite (SiHA) macroporous scaffolds have been prepared by robocasting. In order to optimize their bone regeneration properties, we have  manufactured these scaffolds presenting different microstructures: nanocrystalline  and crystalline. Moreover, their surfaces have been decorated with vascular  endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to evaluate the potential coupling between  vascularization and bone regeneration. In vitro cell culture tests evidence that  nanocrystalline SiHA hinders pre-osteblast proliferation, whereas the presence of  VEGF enhances the biological functions of both endothelial cells and  pre-osteoblasts. The bone regeneration capability has been evaluated using an  osteoporotic sheep model. In vivo observations strongly correlate with in vitro cell  culture tests. Those scaffolds made of nanocrystalline SiHA were colonized by  fibrous tissue, promoted inflammatory response and fostered osteoclast recruitment.  These observations discard nanocystalline SiHA as a suitable material for bone  regeneration purposes. On the contrary, those scaffolds made of crystalline SiHA and  decorated with VEGF exhibited bone regeneration properties, with high ossification  degree, thicker trabeculae and higher presence of osteoblasts and blood vessels.  Considering these results, macroporous scaffolds made of SiHA and decorated with  VEGF are suitable bone grafts for regeneration purposes, even in adverse  pathological scenarios such as osteoporosis. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: For the  first time, the in vivo behavior of scaffolds made of silicon substituted  hydroxyapatites (SiHA) has been evaluated under osteoporosis conditions. In order to  optimize the bone regeneration properties of these bioceramics, 3D macroporous  scaffolds have been manufactured by robocasting and implanted in osteoporotic sheep.  Our experimental design shed light on the important issue of the biological response  of nano-sized bioceramics vs highly crystalline bioceramics, as well as on the  importance of coupling vascularization and bone growth processes by decorating SiHA  scaffolds with vascular endothelial growth factor.},

Cells were cultured for 8 d and then transferred to  zinc-free medium and treated with varying concentrations (0-50 microM) of zinc.  Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was used as a measure of osteoblast  differentiation, and bone nodules were detected by von Kossa staining. After 4, 6,  and 8 d of treatment, zinc increased ALP activity at 1 and 10 microM, but decreased  activity at 50 microM. After 9 d of treatment, zinc increased both the number and  area of mineralized bone nodules at low concentrations (1 and 10 microM), but  decreased both at higher concentrations (25 and 50 microM). These findings  demonstrate that zinc has biphasic effects on the differentiation and mineralization  of human osteoblast-like cells.},

Calcium phosphates  (CaPs) are widely used in bone tissue engineering strategies as they have  similarities to bone apatite except for the absence of trace elements (TEs) in the  CaPs. Bioactive glasses (BGs) have also been used successfully in clinic for  craniomaxillofacial and dental applications during the last two decades due to their  excellent potential for bonding with bone and inducing osteoblastic differentiation.  In this study, we evaluated the osteogenic effects of the ionic dissolution products  of the quaternary Si-Sr-Zn-Mg-codoped CaP (TEs-CaP) or 45S5 Bioglass\textregistered{} (45S5 BG),  both as mixtures and separately, on rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells  (rOMSCs \& rMSCs) from osteoporotic and normal animals, using an MTT test and  Alizarin Red S staining. The materials enhanced cell proliferation and osteogenic  differentiation, especially the combination of the BG and TEs-CaP. Analysis by  quantitative PCR and ELISA indicated that the expression of osteogenic-specific  genes and proteins were elevated. These investigations suggest that the TEs-CaP and  45S5 BG operate synergistically to create an extracellular environment that promotes  proliferation and terminal osteogenic differentiation of both osteoporotic and  normal rMSCs.},

Our aim is to explore the possible association between gut  microbiota and BMD. METHODS: A total of 3,321 independent loci of gut microbiota  were used to calculate the individual polygenic risk score (PRS) for 114 gut  microbiota-related traits. The individual genotype data were obtained from UK  Biobank cohort. Linear regressions were then conducted to evaluate the possible  association of gut microbiota with L1-L4 BMD (n = 4,070), total BMD (n = 4,056), and  femur total BMD (n = 4,054), respectively. PLINK 2.0 was used to detect the  single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) \texttimes{} gut microbiota interaction effect on the  risks of L1-L4 BMD, total BMD, and femur total BMD, respectively. RESULTS: We  detected five, three, and seven candidate gut microbiota-related traits for L1-L4  BMD, total BMD, and femur BMD, respectively, such as genus Dialister (p = 0.004) for  L1-L4 BMD, and genus Eisenbergiella (p = 0.046) for total BMD. We also detected two  common gut microbiota-related traits shared by L1-L4 BMD, total BMD, and femur total  BMD, including genus Escherichia Shigella and genus Lactococcus. Interaction  analysis of BMD detected several genes that interacted with gut microbiota, such as  phospholipase D1 (PLD1) and endomucin (EMCN) interacting with genus Dialister in  total BMD, and COL12A1 and Discs Large MAGUK Scaffold Protein 2 (DLG2) interacting  with genus Lactococcus in femur BMD. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest associations  between gut microbiota and BMD, which will be helpful to further explore the  regulation mechanism and intervention gut microbiota of BMD.

  abstract = {The maintenance of the mechanical integrity of the skeleton depends on bone remodeling, the well-coordinated balance between bone formation by osteoblasts and  bone resorption by osteoclasts. The coupled action of osteoblasts and osteoclasts is  regulated by the action of many local and circulating hormones and factors as well  as central regulation by a neurological mechanism. We have previously shown that  lactoferrin can promote bone growth. At physiological concentrations, lactoferrin  potently stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of primary osteoblasts and  acts as a survival factor. Lactoferrin also affects osteoclasts, potently inhibiting  their formation. In vivo, local injection of lactoferrin results in substantial  increases in bone formation and bone area. In a critical bone-defect model in vivo,  lactoferrin was also seen to promote bone growth. The mitogenic effect of  lactoferrin in osteoblast-like cells is mediated mainly through low-density  lipoprotein-receptor protein-1 (LRP1), a member of the low-density  lipoprotein-receptor-related proteins that are primarily known as endocytic  receptors; however, LRP1 is not necessary for the anti-apoptotic actions of  lactoferrin. Lactoferrin also induces the activation of p42/44 mitogen-activated  protein kinase (MAPK) signalling and the PI3-kinase-dependent phosphorylation of Akt  in osteoblasts. In this study, we examined other properties of lactoferrin and the  way they affect osteogenic activity. The degree of glycosylation, iron-binding, and  the structure-activity relationships indicate that lactoferrin maintains osteogenic  activity in deglycosylated, holo, and apo forms, and in with various small fragments  of the molecule. These data suggest that lactoferrin signals through more than 1  membrane-bound receptor to produce its anabolic skeletal effects, and that it  signals through diverse pathways. We conclude that lactoferrin might have a  physiological role in bone growth and healing and a potential therapeutic role as an  anabolic factor in osteoporosis.},

  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: To define the prevalence, severity, type and pathogenesis of osteopenia in idiopathic hemochromatosis. DESIGN: Prospective study conducted over  18 months. SETTING: Tertiary care center. SUBJECTS: Twenty-two men with idiopathic  hemochromatosis and 20 age-matched controls. There were 5 hypogonadal patients, 9  eugonadal nonvenesected patients, and 8 eugonadal venesected patients. MEASUREMENTS  AND MAIN RESULTS: All patients and controls were evaluated by spinal radiography,  spinal and forearm bone mineral density estimations, dynamic skeletal  histomorphometry, and serum biochemistry. Ten patients (45\%; 95\% CI, 24\% to 68\%) had  osteoporosis as defined by spinal and forearm bone density measurements. Trabecular  bone volumes were significantly reduced in the patients (the difference in means  between patients and age-matched controls was 3.9\%; CI, 1.3\% to 6.7\%). No patient  had osteomalacia. Hypogonadal men had lower bone mass measurements than eugonadal  men (radial bone density: beta coefficient = -20.5; CI, -29.2 to -11.8; trabecular  bone volume: beta coefficient = -7.1; CI, -10.8 to -3.3). Osteoid and osteoblastic  surfaces and bone formation rates were significantly greater in the eugonadal  venesected compared with the eugonadal nonvenesected persons (P less than 0.05 for  all measurements). CONCLUSIONS: A significant decrease in bone density is seen in  idiopathic hemochromatosis, particularly when hypogonadism is present. Low serum  free-testosterone concentrations rather than the calciotrophic hormones determine  bone mass in this condition.},

  abstract = {Silicon is essential for bone formation. A low-silicon diet leads to bone defects, and numerous animal models have demonstrated that silicon supplementation increases  bone mineral density (BMD) and reduces bone fragility. However, the exact mechanism  of this action has not been characterized. In this study, we aimed to determine the  role of biological silicon in the induction of osteoblast differentiation and the  possible underlying mechanism. We examined whether orthosilicic acid promotes  collagen type 1 (COL-1) and osteocalcin synthesis through the bone morphogenetic  protein-2 (BMP-2)/Smad1/5/runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) signaling  pathway by investigating its effect in vitro at several concentrations on COL-1 and  osteocalcin synthesis in human osteosarcoma cell lines (MG-63 and U2-OS). The  expression of relevant proteins was detected by Western blotting following exposure  to noggin, an inhibitor of BMP-2. In MG-63 cells, immunofluorescence methods were  applied to detect changes in the expression of BMP-2, phosphorylated Smad1/5  (P-Smad1/5), and RUNX2. Furthermore, rat bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were  used to determine the effect of orthosilicic acid on osteogenic differentiation.  Exposure to 10~{$\mu$}M orthosilicic acid markedly increased the expression of BMP-2,  P-Smad1/5, RUNX2, COL-1, and osteocalcin in osteosarcoma cell lines. Enhanced ALP  activity and the formation of mineralized nodules were also observed under these  conditions. Furthermore, preconditioning with noggin inhibited the silicon-induced  upregulation of P-Smad1/5, RUNX2, and COL-1 expression. In conclusion, the  BMP-2/Smad1/5/RUNX2 signaling pathway participates in the silicon-mediated induction  of COL-1 and osteocalcin synthesis, and orthosilicic acid promotes the osteogenic  differentiation of rat BMSCs.},

  abstract = {Osteoporosis may complicate iron overload diseases such as genetic hemochromatosis. However, molecular mechanisms involved in the iron-related osteoporosis remains  poorly understood. Recent in vitro studies support a role of osteoblast impairment  in iron-related osteoporosis. Our aim was to analyse the impact of excess iron in  Hfe-/- mice on osteoblast activity and on bone microarchitecture. We studied the  bone formation rate, a dynamic parameter reflecting osteoblast activity, and the  bone phenotype of Hfe-/- male mice, a mouse model of human hemochromatosis, by using  histomorphometry. Hfe-/- animals were sacrificed at 6 months and compared to  controls. We found that bone contains excess iron associated with increased hepatic  iron concentration in Hfe-/- mice. We have shown that animals with iron overload  have decreased bone formation rate, suggesting a direct impact of iron excess on  active osteoblasts number. For bone mass parameters, we showed that iron deposition  was associated with bone loss by producing microarchitectural impairment with a  decreased tendency in bone trabecular volume and trabecular number. A  disorganization of trabecular network was found with marrow spaces increased, which  was confirmed by enhanced trabecular separation and star volume of marrow spaces.  These microarchitectural changes led to a loss of connectivity and complexity in the  trabecular network, which was confirmed by decreased interconnectivity index and  increased Minkowski's fractal dimension. Our results suggest for the first time in a  genetic hemochromatosis mouse model, that iron overload decreases bone formation and  leads to alterations in bone mass and microarchitecture. These observations support  a negative effect of iron on osteoblast recruitment and/or function, which may  contribute to iron-related osteoporosis.},

It was the aim of the present study to investigate the skeletal  effects of alimentary zinc deficiency in growing rats using quantitative bone  histomorphometry. Twenty-four male Sprague Dawley rats with a mean initial body  weight of 101 +/- 2 g were allocated in two groups of 12 rats each and had free  access to a semi-synthetic, casein-based, zinc-deficient diet (0.76 mg zinc/kg) or  to the same diet supplemented with 60 mg zinc per kg. All rats were sacrificed 42  days after the start of the experiment and the right distal femur was removed for  bone histomorphometry. Relative to controls (+Zn), the zinc-deficient rats (-Zn) had  a significantly lower body weight and about an 80\% reduction in plasma and femur  zinc concentration. The histomorphometric evaluation of the distal femoral  metaphysis showed that zinc deficiency led to a 45\% reduction (p {$<$} 0.01) in  cancellous bone mass and to a deterioration of trabecular bone architecture, with  fewer and thinner trabeculae. The osteopenia in -Zn rats was accompanied by  significant reductions in osteoid perimeter (-31\%, p {$<$} 0.05), osteoblast perimeter  (-30\%, p {$<$} 0.05), and osteoclast number (-38\%, p {$<$} 0.01) relative to +Zn controls.  We conclude that zinc deficiency induced low turnover osteopenia in femoral  cancellous bone of growing rats. These results support the hypothesis that zinc  deficiency during growth may impair the accumulation of maximal bone mass in humans;  additionally, they suggest that zinc deficiency may play a role as a risk factor in  the pathogenesis of osteoporosis.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Redox homeostasis plays an important role in the osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) for bone engineering. Oxidative stress (OS)  is believed to induce osteoporosis by changing bone homeostasis. Selenium  nanoparticles (SeNPs), an antioxidant with pleiotropic pharmacological activity,  prevent bone loss. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the osteogenic  activity during hMSC-SeNP interaction is unclear. METHODS: This study assessed the  effects of different concentrations (25, 50, 100, and 300 ng/mL) of SeNPs on the  cell viability and differentiation ability of human embryonic stem cell-derived  hMSCs. In addition, we analyzed OS markers and their effect on mitogen-activated  protein kinase (MAPK) and Forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) during osteogenesis. RESULTS:  SeNPs increased the cell viability of hMSCs and induced their differentiation toward  an osteogenic over an adipogenic lineage by enhancing osteogenic transcription and  mineralization, while inhibiting Nile red staining and adipogenic gene expression.  By preventing excessive reactive oxygen species accumulation, SeNPs increased  antioxidant levels in hMSCs undergoing osteogenesis compared to untreated cells. In  addition, SeNPs significantly upregulated the gene and protein expression of  phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and FOXO3a, with no significant change  in the expression levels of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and p38 MAPK.  CONCLUSION: The results approved that low concentrations of SeNPs might enhance the  cell viability and osteogenic potential of hMSCs by moderating OS. Increased JNK and  FOXO3a expression shows that SeNPs might enhance osteogenesis via activation of the  JNK/FOXO3 pathway. In addition, SeNP co-supplementation might prevent bone loss by  enhancing osteogenesis and, thus, can be an effective candidate for treating  osteoporosis through cell-based therapy.},

  abstract = {MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells represent a suitable model for studying osteogenic development in vitro. The current investigation extends our previous work on the  response of these cells to hydrogen peroxide by considering the effects of reactive  oxygen species from other sources, and by determining whether differentiation alters  sensitivity to oxidative damage. Aspects of hydrogen peroxide-mediated apoptotic and  necrotic death were also examined. Cell viability was determined using the Alamar  Blue assay; and accompanying morphological changes monitored by phase-contrast  microscopy. Sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide increased significantly in cultures  which had been induced to differentiate. Hydrogen peroxide and copper (II) ions,  when combined, produced greater damage than hydrogen peroxide alone, whilst the  hydroxyl radical scavengers mannitol or dimethylsulphoxide had no effect.  Cyclosporin A and nicotinamide afforded partial protection. The tryptophan  metabolite, 3-hydroxykynurenine significantly reduced viability, although  3-hydroxyanthranilic acid did not. The xanthine/xanthine oxidase system also reduced  cell viability, an effect prevented by catalase but potentiated by superoxide  dismutase. S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine did not impair viability at the  concentrations tested. Cultures were resistant to mitochondrial poisoning by  potassium cyanide, but succumbed to 24-h exposures to 3-nitropropionic acid (1 mM).  The results reveal a differential sensitivity of MC3T3-E1 cells to hydrogen  peroxide-induced oxidative stress, an enhancement of sensitivity by cellular  differentiation, and a potential preference for the glycolytic pathway by MC3T3-E1  cells. This study gives new insight into how bone cells may succumb to the toxic  effects of oxidative stress generated by different stimuli and has relevance to  conditions such as osteoporosis.},

Osteoblastic  alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a key enzyme involved in the process of bone formation  and osteoid mineralization. In this study we investigated the direct effect of  strontium (SR and SrCl2) on the activity of ALP obtained from UMR106 osteosarcoma  cells, as well as its possible interactions with the divalent cations Zn(2+) and  Mg(2+). In the presence of Mg(2+), both SR and SrCl2 (0.05-0.5 mM) significantly  increased ALP activity (15-66 \% above basal), and this was dose-dependent in the  case of SR. The stimulatory effect of strontium disappeared in the absence of  Mg(2+). The cofactor Zn(2+) also increased ALP activity (an effect that reached a  plateau at 2 mM), and co-incubation of 2 mM Zn(2+) with 0.05-0.5 mM SR showed an  additive effect on ALP activity stimulation. SR induced a dose-dependent decrease in  the Km of ALP (and thus an increase in affinity for its substrate) with a maximal  effect at 0.1 mM. Co-incubation with 2 mM Zn(2+) further decreased Km in all cases.  These direct effects of SR on osteoblastic ALP activity could be indicating an  alternative mechanism by which this compound may regulate bone matrix  mineralization.},

Results  demonstrated that the growth of nOB and oOB cultured on P558 was not affected  negatively when compared to control. Cells on P558 did not show any alteration in  terms of adhesion, proliferation, and metabolic marker production in nOB and oOB  cultures, and a significant increase in ALP, OC, and TGF-beta1 production was  observed. SEM images revealed no alteration in cell morphology.

Our results demonstrate that, whilst cell  proliferation was highest on low-fluoride-containing BG, markers for differentiation  and mineralization were highest on BG with the highest fluoride contents, a likely  effect of a combination of surface effects and ion release. Furthermore, osteoblasts  exposed to the dissolution products of fluoride-containing BG or early doses of  sodium fluoride showed increased alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker for bone  mineralization, suggesting that fluoride can direct osteoblast differentiation.  Taken together, these results suggest that BG that can release therapeutic levels of  fluoride may find use in a range of bone regeneration applications.},

Significant increased apoptosis were observed in zinc deficiency group (ZnD: 5 {$\mu$}M  TPEN and 1 {$\mu$}M zinc) compared with untreated control or zinc adequacy group (ZnA: 5  {$\mu$}M TPEN and 15 {$\mu$}M zinc). The mitochondrial membrane potential was strikingly reduced  in ZnD group. Furthermore, we observed that the levels of Bax in mitochondria  fraction and cyto c, AIF, and cleaved caspase-3/-9 in cytosol fraction were  increased in ZnD group. We proposed that zinc deficiency would induce the  translocation of Bax into mitochondria, which could lead to the reduction in  mitochondrial membrane potential as well as the increase in mitochondrial membrane  permeability. In addition, cyto c and AIF were released from mitochondria into the  cytosol, which finally activated caspase-dependent and caspase-independent apoptosis  processes in MC3T3-E1 cells.

According to the length of the estrogenic deprivation period,  postmenopausal women with osteoporosis presented either increased (cohort 1) or  decreased (cohort 2) OPG levels demonstrating osteoblast activation and osteoblast  apoptosis stimulation, respectively. The bone levels of Zn(2+) were significantly  decreased showing limited proliferation and differentiation of the osteoblasts.},

  abstract = {Iron overload has recently been connected with bone mineral density in osteoporosis. However, to date, the effect of iron overload on osteoblasts remains poorly  understood. The purpose of this study is to examine osteoblast biological activity  under iron overload. The osteoblast cells (hFOB1.19) were cultured in a medium  supplemented with different concentrations (50, 100, and 200 {$\mu$}M) of ferric ammonium  citrate as a donor of ferric ion. Intracellular iron was measured with a confocal  laser scanning microscope. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by  2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate fluorophotometry. Osteoblast biological activities  were evaluated by measuring the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and  mineralization function. Results indicated that iron overload could consequently  increase intracellular iron concentration and intracellular ROS levels in a  concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, ALP activity was suppressed, and a  decline in the number of mineralized nodules was observed in in vitro cultured  osteoblast cells. According to these results, it seems that iron overload probably  inhibits osteoblast function through higher oxidative stress following increased  intracellular iron concentrations.},

Simultaneously,  biocompatibility of the material was tested in vitro, on osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 and  epithelial Caco-2 cells in culture. The material was shown to be biocompatible and  nontoxic when added to epithelial monolayers in vitro, while it caused a substantial  decrease in the cell viability as well as deformation of the cytoskeleton and cell  morphology when incubated with the osteoblastic cells. In the course of 6 months  after the implantation of the material containing different amounts of cobalt,  ranging from 5 to 12 wt\%, in the osteoporotic alveolar bone of the lower jaw, the  following parameters were investigated: histopathological parameters, alkaline  phosphatase and alveolar bone density. The best result in terms of osteoporotic bone  tissue regeneration was observed for hydroxyapatite nanoparticles with the largest  content of cobalt ions. The histological analysis showed a high level of reparatory  ability of the nanoparticulate material implanted in the bone defect, paralleled by  a corresponding increase in the alveolar bone density. The combined effect of growth  factors from autologous plasma admixed to cobalt-substituted hydroxyapatite was  furthermore shown to have a crucial effect on the augmented osteoporotic bone  regeneration upon the implantation of the biomaterial investigated in this study.},

Ti6Al4V-ELI scaffolds  were prepared by electron beam melting and subsequently coated with  Ca(10)(PO(4))(5.6)(SiO(4))(0.4)(OH)(1.6) following a dip coating method. In vitro  studies demonstrated that SiHA stimulates the proliferation of MC3T3-E1  pre-osteoblastic cells, whereas the adsorption of VEGF stimulates the proliferation  of EC(2) mature endothelial cells. In vivo studies were carried out in an  osteoporotic sheep model, evidencing that only the simultaneous presence of both  components led to a significant increase of new tissue formation in osteoporotic  bone. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Reconstruction of bones after severe trauma or  tumors extirpation is one of the most challenging tasks in the field of orthopedic  surgery. This scenario is even more complicated in the case of osteoporotic  patients, since their bone regeneration capability is decreased. In this work we  present a porous implant that promotes bone regeneration even in osteoporotic bone.  By coating the implant with osteogenic bioceramics such as silicon substituted  hydroxyapatite and subsequent adsorption of vascular endothelial growth factor,  these implants stimulate the bone ingrowth when they are implanted in osteoporotic  sheep.},

Quantitative real-time  PCR analyses revealed the osteoblast-specific genes alp, runx2a, runx2b, and sp7 in  morphants are down-regulated. Furthermore, we confirmed qRT-PCR results by in situ  hybridization and found down-regulated genes related to osteoblast function in  hepcidin morphants. Most importantly, we revealed that hepcidin was capable of  removing whole-body iron which facilitated larval recovery from the reductions in  bone formation and osteogenesis induced by iron overload.},

  abstract = {Osteoblast and osteoclast activity is disrupted in post-menopausal osteoporosis. Thus, to fully address this imbalance, therapies should reduce bone resorption and  promote bone formation. Dietary factors such as phyto-oestrogens and Zn have  beneficial effects on osteoblast and osteoclast activity. However, the effect of  combinations of these factors has not been widely studied. We therefore examined the  effect of coumestrol, daidzein and genistein in the presence or absence of zinc  sulphate (Zn) on osteoclast and osteoblast activity. Osteoclast differentiation and  bone resorption were significantly reduced by coumestrol (10- 7 m), daidzein (10- 5  m) and genistein (10- 7 m); and this direct anti-osteoclastic action was unaffected  by Zn (10- 5 m). In addition, Zn augmented the inhibitory effect of phyto-oestrogens  on the osteoblast-derived stimulus for osteoclast formation, significantly reducing  the ratio of receptor activator of NF-{$\kappa$}B ligand (RANKL)-to-osteoprotegerin mRNA  expression in human osteoblast. We then examined the effect of these compounds on  osteoblast activity. Mineralisation was enhanced by coumestrol (10- 5 to 10- 7 m),  daidzein (10- 5 to 10- 6 m) and genistein (10- 5 m); and Zn significantly augmented  this response. Zn and phyto-oestrogens also significantly enhanced alkaline  phosphatase activity and Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) mRNA  expression. On the other hand, Zn blunted phyto-oestrogen-induced type I collagen  and osteocalcin expression and suppressed coumestrol and daidzein-stimulated osterix  expression. Zn may therefore modify the anabolic action of phyto-oestrogens,  promoting characteristics associated with early rather than late stages of  osteoblast differentiation. Our data suggest that while Zn enhances the  anti-osteoclastic effect of phyto-oestrogens, it may limit aspects of their anabolic  action on bone matrix formation.},

In this study, the comparative  effects of Fe3+ and Fe2+ on osteoblast differentiation and mineralization were  studied in UMR-106 osteoblast cells by using ferric ammonium citrate and ferrous  ammonium sulfate as Fe3+ and Fe2+ donors, respectively. Effects of 1,25  dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] and iron chelator deferiprone on iron uptake  ability of osteoblasts were examined, and the potential protective ability of  1,25(OH)2D3, deferiprone and extracellular calcium treatment in osteoblast cell  survival under iron overload was also elucidated. The differential effects of Fe3+  and Fe2+ on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in osteoblasts were also  compared. Our results showed that both iron species suppressed alkaline phosphatase  gene expression and mineralization with the stronger effects from Fe3+ than Fe2+.  1,25(OH)2D3 significantly increased the intracellular iron but minimally affected  osteoblast cell survival under iron overload. Deferiprone markedly decreased  intracellular iron in osteoblasts, but it could not recover iron-induced osteoblast  cell death. Interestingly, extracellular calcium was able to rescue osteoblasts from  iron-induced osteoblast cell death. Additionally, both iron species could induce ROS  production and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in osteoblasts with the stronger effects from  Fe3+. In conclusions, Fe3+ and Fe2+ differentially compromised the osteoblast  functions and viability, which can be alleviated by an increase in extracellular  ionized calcium, but not 1,25(OH)2D3 or iron chelator deferiprone. This study has  provided the invaluable information for therapeutic design targeting specific iron  specie(s) in iron overload-induced osteoporosis.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factor (FGF23) is a protein that is produced by osteoblasts and osteocytes. Increased serum levels of FGF23 have been associated  with increased risks of osteoporotic fractures and cardiovascular disease,  particularly in participants with poor renal function. Serum iron (Fe) has been  suggested as a regulator of FGF23 homeostasis. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether Fe  and iron status are determinants of the levels of intact FGF23 (iFGF23) in elderly  men. METHODS: The MrOS study is a population-based study of elderly men (N=1010;  mean age, 75.3years; range, 69-81years). The levels of Fe, transferrin saturation  (TS), and ferritin were evaluated in relation to the serum concentrations of iFGF23  before and after adjustments for confounders. RESULTS: TS {$<$}15\% was found in 3.5\%  (34/977) of the participants, who had a higher median level iFGF23 compared with the  remaining subjects (47.4{$\mu$}mol/L vs. 41.9{$\mu$}mol/L, p=0.008). The levels of iFGF23  correlated negatively (un-adjusted) with the levels of Fe (r=-0.17, p{$<$}0.001), TS  (r=-0.16, p{$<$}0.001) and serum ferritin (r=-0.07, p=0.022). In addition, in  participants with estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFRCystatin C{$>$}60mL/min, the  levels of iFGF23 correlated (age-adjusted) negatively with the levels of Fe  (r=-0.15, p{$<$}0.001) and TS (r=-0.17, p{$<$}0.001). The level of iFGF23 correlated  positively (un-adjusted) with lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) (r=0.14,  p{$<$}0.001), total body BMD (r=0.11, p=0.001), and total hip BMD (r=0.09, p=0.004). The  corresponding correlations, when adjusted for age, weight, and height were: r=0.08,  p=0.018; r=0.05, p=0.120; and r=0.02, p=0.624, respectively. No associations were  found between BMD and the levels of Fe or TS. Multiple step-wise linear regression  analyses [adjusting for age, body mass index (BMI), comorbidity index, cystatin C,  C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), serum vitamin D 25-OH (25OHD), phosphate, calcium,  parathyroid hormone (PTH), erythropoietin, hemoglobin, lumbar spine BMD,  apolipoprotein B/A1 ratio] were performed in three separate models with Fe, TS or  ferritin as potential explanatory variables. Fe and TS, but not ferritin, were  independent predictors of iFGF23 level (standardized {$\beta$}-values: -0.10, p{$<$}0.001;  -0.10, p{$<$}0.001; and -0.05, p=0.062, respectively). CONCLUSION: Low levels of Fe in  elderly men are associated with high levels of iFGF23, independently of markers of  inflammation and renal function, suggesting an iron-related pathway for FGF23  regulation.},

Our  results showed that pre-treatment with SAL markedly attenuated the hypoxia-induced  reductions in cell viability, apoptosis, differentiation and mineralization. SAL  down-regulated HIF-1{$\alpha$} expression and inhibited its translocation; however, SAL  increased its transcriptional activity and, consequently, up-regulated vascular  endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In vivo studies further demonstrated that SAL  caused decreases in the mineral, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and BGP concentrations  in the blood of ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Moreover, SAL improved the trabecular  bone microarchitecture and increased bone mineral density in the distal femur.  Additionally, SAL administration partially ameliorated this hypoxia via the  HIF-1{$\alpha$}-VEGF signalling pathway. Our results indicate that SAL prevents bone loss by  enhancing angiogenesis and osteogenesis and that these effects are associated with  the activation of HIF-1{$\alpha$} signalling.},

We, therefore, hypothesized that zinc might be cytoprotective for  bone cells during oxidative stress. The cells were divided into H(2)O(2), zinc and  zinc+H(2)O(2) groups. In the present study, zinc was found to inhibit  H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis in MC3T3-E1 cells, as shown by analysis of Annexin V/PI  double staining. Western blot data showed that in zinc+H(2)O(2)-treated cells, zinc  decreased the levels of AIF, Bax and active caspase-9 and -3, which are  pro-apoptotic factors. And zinc inhibited release of cytochrome c from mitochondria  to cytosol in zinc+H(2)O(2)-treated cells.

  abstract = {Osteoporosis is a bone disease that leads to an increased risk of fracture. Oxidative stress may play a major role in the development of osteoporosis in part by  inhibiting osteoblastic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs). Some  evidence suggested that antioxidant selenium could prevent osteoporosis, but the  underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this work, the effect of sodium selenite on  H{$_2$}O{$_2$}-induced inhibition of osteoblastic differentiation of primary rat bone MSCs and  the related mechanisms were examined. Pretreatment with selenite inhibited the  adverse effect of H{$_2$}O{$_2$} on osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs, based on alkaline  phosphatase activity, gene expression of type I collagen and osteocalcin, and matrix  mineralization. In addition, selenite pretreatment also suppressed the activation of  extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) induced by H{$_2$}O{$_2$}. The above effects were  mediated by the antioxidant effect of selenite. Selenite enhanced the gene  expression and activity of glutathione peroxidase, reversed the decreased total  antioxidant capacity and reduced glutathione, and suppressed reactive oxygen species  production and lipid peroxidation level in H{$_2$}O{$_2$}-treated MSCs. These results showed  that selenite protected MSCs against H{$_2$}O{$_2$}-induced inhibition of osteoblastic  differentiation through inhibiting oxidative stress and ERK activation, which  provided, for the first time, the mechanistic explanation for the negative  association of selenium status and risk of osteoporosis in terms of bone formation.},

Ninety one-day-old Arbor  Acres male broiler chickens administered with control diet (60 mg Mn/kg) and  Mn-deficient diets (40 mg Mn/kg, 8.7 mg Mn/kg) to investigate the effects of Mn  deficiency on morphology of tibia and related signal transduction pathways in  broiler chickens. At the age of 42 days, the bone trabecula, damaged osteoblasts and  OPG/RANKL mRNA expression levels were investigated by histological assessment,  electron microscopic examination and real-time quantitative PCR analysis,  respectively. Results of histological observations showed that decreased trabecular  thickness, trabecular number and trabecular bone area (\%) together with increased  trabecular bone separation were involved in perosis induced by Mn deficiency. The  most striking ultrastructural modifications involved disruption of nuclear membrane  and mitochondria outer membrane, loss of mitochondrion cristae and alteration in  endoplasmic reticulum in osteoblasts of the Mn-deficient groups. Likewise, Mn  deficiency results in a significant (P {$<$} 0.05) decrease in the relative mRNA  expression levels of OPG and RANKL with a significantly higher RANKL/OPG ratio (P {$<$}  0.05). In conclusion, Mn deficiency can affect the development of tibia in broiler  chickens, leading to metaphyseal osteoporosis which may be due to decreased  OPG/RANKL mRNA expression.},

The purpose of this study was to explore the function of  divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) in the pathological processes of osteoporosis.  Osteoblast hFOB1.19 cells were cultured in medium supplemented with different  concentrations (0, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 {$\mu$}mol/L) of ferric ammonium citrate  (FAC) as a donor of ferric ions. We used western blotting and immunofluorescence to  determine the levels of DMT1 after treatment with FAC. Apoptosis was evaluated by  detecting the levels of cleaved caspase 3, BCL2, and BAX with western blotting.  Autophagy was evaluated by detecting the levels of LC3 with western blotting and  immunofluorescence. Beclin-1 expression was also assessed with western blotting. The  autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine was used to determine whether autophagy affects  the apoptosis induced by FAC. Our results show that FAC increased the levels of  DMT1, upregulated the expression of BCL2, and downregulated the apoptosis-related  proteins cleaved caspase 3 and BAX. Both LC3I/LC3II levels and beclin-1 were also  increased, indicating that FAC increases the accumulation of autophagosomes in  hFOB1.19 cells. FAC-induced autophagy was increased by the apoptosis inhibitor 3-MA  but was reduced in DMT1 shRNA hFOB1.19 cells. These results suggest that the  increased expression of DMT1 induces iron overload and iron overload induces  osteoblast autophagy and apoptosis, thus affecting the pathological processes of  osteoporosis. Clarifying the mechanisms underlying the effects of DMT1 will allow  the identification of novel targets for the prevention and treatment of  osteoporosis.},

  abstract = {Glucocorticoids intake is the most common cause of secondary osteoporosis. Clinical studies have shown that 50\% patients develop glucocorticoids-induced osteoporosis  (GCIOP) after taking glucocorticoids for more than 6 months. Hydroxysafflor yellow A  (HYA) is one main active ingredient in Carthamus tinctorius L. Previous studies have  shown that HYA promoted bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into  osteoblasts which promoted bone formation. Therefore, we speculated that HYA has a  therapeutic effect on GCIOP. However, there is no in vivo evidence about the  anti-GCIOP effect of HYA. In this paper, the effect of HYA (0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 {$\mu$}M)  on bone formation in normal zebrafish was investigated firstly. Secondly, the  reversal effect of HYA on GCIOP was also evaluated by zebrafish model. It is  demonstrated that HYA not only promoted bone formation in normal zebrafish (compared  to Control group), but also reversed glucocorticoid induced bone loss (compared to  Prednisolone group) according to the intervention of HYA in upregulating the area of  mineralized bones (p {$<$} 0.01), increasing cumulative optical density (p {$<$} 0.01),  promoting bone formation related gene expression (AKP, Type I, Runx2, OPG, and OCN,  p {$<$} 0.01), inhibiting bone resorption related gene expression (TRACP, p {$<$} 0.01), and  elevating whole-body trace mineral elements (Ca, P, K, Mg, Zn, and Fe) levels (p {$<$}  0.01). In conclusion, HYA had the potential to prevent and heal GCIOP by promoting  bone mineralization, osteoblasts viability, and bone collagen expression and  inhibiting bone resorption.},

Doping is an efficient method to enhance the catalase-mimetic activity of MnO(2),  which can potentially ameliorate osteogenesis under oxidative stress. Herein, Zn(2+)  doped MnO(2) (Zn-MnO(2)) nanocoating was fabricated on orthopedic titanium implant  by a facile UV-photolysis reaction. The Zn-MnO(2) nanocoating showed better  cytocompatibility than the MnO(2) nanocoating, as indicated by enhanced cell  proliferation, differentiation and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts. This  was probably due to the increased surface hydrophilicity as well as the combination  effect of released Zn(2+) and Mn(2+) from the Zn-MnO(2) nanocoating. Importantly,  the Zn-MnO(2) nanocoating with enhanced catalase-like activity exerted greater  effects to suppress the intracellular oxidation products generation and prevent the  depletion of dismutase superoxide levels under H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress,  which in turn protected MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast functions. Overall, surface  modification of titanium implants with the Zn-MnO(2) nanocoating could be utilized  to ameliorate oxidative stress-inhibited osteogenesis.},

Estimation of bone density using  existing methods in experimental models has its advantages as well as drawbacks.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, the X-ray histogram edge detection technique  was used to estimate the bone mass density in ovariectomized rats treated orally  with germinated brown rice (GBR) bioactives, and the results were compared with  estimated results obtained using Archimede's principle. New bone cell proliferation  was assessed by histology and immunohistochemical reaction using polyclonal nuclear  antigen. Additionally, serum alkaline phosphatase activity, serum and bone calcium  and zinc concentrations were detected using a chemistry analyzer and atomic  absorption spectroscopy. Rats were divided into groups of six as follows: sham  (nonovariectomized, nontreated); ovariectomized, nontreated; and ovariectomized and  treated with estrogen, or Remifemin\textregistered, GBR-phenolics, acylated steryl glucosides,  gamma oryzanol, and gamma amino-butyric acid extracted from GBR at different doses.  RESULTS: Our results indicate a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase  activity, serum and bone calcium, and zinc and ash content in the treated groups  compared with the ovariectomized nontreated group (P {$<$} 0.05). Bone density increased  significantly (P {$<$} 0.05) in groups treated with estrogen, GBR, Remifemin\textregistered, and gamma  oryzanol compared to the ovariectomized nontreated group. Histological sections  revealed more osteoblasts in the treated groups when compared with the untreated  groups. A polyclonal nuclear antigen reaction showing proliferating new cells was  observed in groups treated with estrogen, Remifemin\textregistered, GBR, acylated steryl  glucosides, and gamma oryzanol. There was a good correlation between bone mass  densities estimated using Archimede's principle and the edge detection technique  between the treated groups (r (2) = 0.737, P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Our study shows  that GBR bioactives increase bone density, which might be via the activation of zinc  formation and increased calcium content, and that X-ray edge detection technique is  effective in the measurement of bone density and can be employed effectively in this  respect.},

This study  aimed to investigate the effects of zinc on osteoblast differentiation in human bone  marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) and to identify the molecular  mechanisms of these effects. In hBMSCs, zinc exposure resulted in a dose-dependent  increase in osteogenesis and increased mRNA and protein levels of the master  transcriptional factor RUNX2. Analyzing the upstream signaling pathways of RUNX2, we  found that protein kinase A (PKA) signaling inhibition blocked zinc-induced  osteogenic effects. Zinc exposure increased transcriptional activity and protein  levels of phospho-CREB and enhanced translocation of phospho-CREB into the nucleus.  These effects were reversed by H-89, a potent inhibitor of PKA. Moreover, zinc  exposure led to dose-dependent increases in levels of intracellular cyclic adenosine  monophosphate (cAMP). These findings indicate that zinc activates the PKA signaling  pathway by triggering an increase in intracellular cAMP, leading to enhanced  osteogenic differentiation in hBMSCs. Our results suggest that zinc exerts  osteogenic effects in hBMSCs by activation of RUNX2 via the cAMP-PKA-CREB signaling  pathway. Zinc supplementation may offer a promise as a potential pharmaceutical  therapy for osteoporosis and other bone loss conditions.},

Our results indicate that iron impact the  S1P/S1PR signalizing axis and suggest that iron can affect the S1P process and favor  the occurrence of osteoporosis during chronic iron overload. INTRODUCTION: Systemic  iron excess favors the development of osteoporosis, especially during genetic  hemochromatosis. The cellular mechanisms involved are still unclear despite numerous  data supporting a direct effect of iron on bone biology. Therefore, the aim of this  study was to characterize mechanisms involved in the iron-related osteoblast  impairment. METHODS: We studied, by using the MG-63 cell lines, the effect of iron  excess on SPNS2 gene expression which was previously identified by us as potentially  iron-regulated. Cell-type specificity was investigated with hepatoma HepG2 and  enterocyte-like Caco-2 cell lines as well as in iron-overloaded mouse liver. The  SPNS2-associated function was also investigated in MG-63 cells by fluxomic strategy  which led us to determinate the S1P efflux in iron excess condition. RESULTS: We  showed in MG-63 cells that iron exposure strongly increased the mRNA level of the  SPNS2 gene. This was not observed in HepG2, in Caco-2 cells, and in mouse livers.  Fluxomic study performed concomitantly on MG-63 cells revealed an unexpected  decrease in the cellular capacity to export S1P. Iron excess did not modulate SPHK1,  SPHK2, SGPL1, or SGPP1 gene expression, but decreased COL1A1 and S1PR1 mRNA levels,  suggesting a functional implication of low extracellular S1P concentration on the  S1P/S1PR signalizing axis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that iron impacts the  S1P/S1PR signalizing axis in the MG-63 cell line and suggest that iron can affect  the bone-associated S1P pathway and favor the occurrence of osteoporosis during  chronic iron overload.},

  abstract = {The life expectancy of patients with thalassemia has greatly improved over the last decade as a result of regular transfusions and increased compliance with iron  chelation therapy, however, this improvement is often accompanied by a series of  serious complications including osteopenia and osteoporosis. The pathogenesis of  these skeletal disorders is multifactorial which may be due to hormonal deficiency,  compromised nutritional status, bone marrow expansion due to erythroid hyperplasia,  increased iron stores or desferrioxamine toxicity. The non invasive assessment of  bone turnover has markedly improved with the development of specific and sensitive  markers of bone formation. The aim of this work is to assess the value of bone  formation markers in patients with beta-thalassemia. To achieve this goal, 36  patients with thalassemia were recruited in this study. There were 20 males (56.6\%)  and 16 females (44.4\%) and their ages ranged from 3 to 18 years. A control group of  20 apparently healthy subjects of matched age and sex was used. The patients were  selected from the outpatient clinic and inpatients of the Hematology/Oncology Unit  of Mansoura University Children's Hospital (MUCH). The selected subjects were  subjected to thorough history taking, clinical examination, radiological evaluation  and laboratory investigations in the form of: complete blood count, serum iron,  serum ferritin, total iron binding capacity, serum calcium, serum phosphorus and  estimation of bone formation markers as alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin. The  results were as follows: serum calcium level was within normal range and showed no  statistical significance (p = 0.176) when compared to the control group, while serum  phosphorus level was significantly higher in thalassemic patients than the controls  (p = 0.002); this may reflect hypoparathyroidism. Analysis of the level of bone  formation markers showed serum alkaline phosphatase levels slightly higher in  patients than controls but not significant (p = 0.055), and this elevation can be  referred to associated liver disease in these patients. On the other hand,  osteocalcin level was significantly lower in patients than controls (p = 0.011), and  this may be due to osteoblast poisoning by iron overload. In conclusion, thalassemic  patients have unbalanced bone turnover between the bone formation and resorption  markers and this is evidenced by non significant changes or decreased levels of bone  formation markers, while bone resorption is an active process.},

For some vitamins and minerals an  important role in bone metabolism is known or suggested. Calcium and vitamin D  support bone mineral density and are basic components in most preventive strategies.  Magnesium is involved in a number of activities supporting bone strength,  preservation, and remodeling. Fluorine and strontium have bone-forming effects.  However, high amounts of both elements may reduce bone strength. Boron is especially  effective in case of vitamin D, magnesium, and potassium deficiency. Vitamin K is  essential for the activation of osteocalcin. Vitamin C is an important stimulus for  osteoblast-derived proteins. Increasing the recommended amounts (US RDA 1989),  adequate intakes (US DRI 1997), or assumed normal intakes of mentioned food  components may lead to a considerable reduction or even prevention of bone loss,  especially in late postmenopausal women and the elderly.},

To characterize this bone disorder, we examined  double-tetracycline-labeled iliac crest bone biopsies and serum biochemistry in 53  black male drinkers, 38 with (Fe+) and 15 without (Fe-) iron overload, and in  controls. We reasoned that abnormalities found in both patient groups were likely to  be caused by alcohol abuse and those found only in the Fe+ group to be caused by  iron overload and hypovitaminosis C (iron/C-). The patient groups differed only with  respect to greater erosion depth (p {$<$} 0.05) and abnormal markers of iron overload in  the Fe+ group. Ascorbic acid levels were lower in the Fe+ group than in controls (p  {$<$} 0.001). Bone volume and trabecular thickness were significantly lower in both  patient groups compared with controls and therefore likely caused by alcohol. There  were no positive correlations between formation and erosion variables in either  patient group, which suggests uncoupling of formation from erosion, possibly as a  result of alcohol abuse. Prolonged mineralization lag time associated with thin  osteoid seams was found in 32\% of patients, affecting both groups. This rules out  osteomalacia and suggests osteoblast dysfunction, probably caused by alcohol. The  number of iron granules in the marrow correlated with erosion depth (r = 0.373, p {$<$}  0.01), trabecular number (r = -0.295, p {$<$} 0.05), and trabecular separation (r =  0.347, p {$<$} 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

These studies included  approximately 250 burned children, and they were conducted to evaluate the impact of  severe burn on markers of bone formation and bone metabolism. Some trials also  analyzed current therapy regimens such as pamidronate and vitamin D. The clinical  utility of these outlined biomarkers is uncertain with regard to acute burn care, as  the current literature remains unclear. This review thus serves to address the  impact of severe burn on markers of bone formation and bone metabolism in pediatric  patients but will not focus on the clinical utility of the markers. The aim of this  review is to summarize the findings of the trials to guide the future care of burned  patients to maximize bone recovery.},

AHZ (10, 30 and 100 mg/kg body weight/d) was orally administered to ovariectomized  rats for 6 weeks. Ovariectomy produced a significant decrease in estradiol,  calcitonin, calcium and inorganic phosphorus concentrations in the serum as compared  with those from sham-operated rats. The dose of 30 and 100 mg AHZ/kg prevented any  decrease in serum inorganic phosphorus concentration caused by ovariectomy. Alkaline  phosphatase activity, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and calcium contents in the  femoral diaphysis of ovariectomized rats significantly decreased in comparison with  those from sham-operated rats. These decreases were completely prevented by the dose  of AHZ (10, 30 and 100 mg/kg). Electron microscopical analysis showed a rough  alteration of bone matrix in the femoral diaphysis of ovariectomized rats. This  alteration was clearly modified by the doses of AHZ (10, 30 and 100 mg/kg). Also,  dosages of AHZ (30 and 100 mg/kg) restored the atrophy of osteoblasts and cartilage  cells caused by ovariectomy. The present study suggests that oral administration of  AHZ can prevent the deterioration of bone metabolism by ovariectomy. AHZ may have a  therapeutic role in the treatment of osteoporosis.},

  abstract = {We report the effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) on the responsiveness of osteoclasts to cellular, hormonal, and ionic signals. Osteoclasts isolated from  neonatal rat long bones were dispersed onto either slices of devitalised cortical  bone (for the measurement of resorptive activity) or glass coverslips (for the  determination of the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]). Osteoclasts were  also cocultured on bone with osteoblastlike, UMR-106 cells. Bone resorption was  quantitated by scanning electron microscopy and computer-assisted morphometry. PEMF  application to osteoblast-osteoclast cocultures for 18 hr resulted in a twofold  stimulation of bone resorption. In contrast, resorption by isolated osteoclasts  remained unchanged in the presence of PEMFs, suggesting that osteoblasts were  necessary for the PEMF-induced resorption simulation seen in osteoblast-osteoclast  cocultures. Furthermore, the potent inhibitory action of the hormone calcitonin on  bone resorption was unaffected by PEMF application. However, PEMFs completely  reversed another quite distinct action of calcitonin on the osteoclast: its potent  inhibitory effect on the activation of the divalent cation-sensing (or Ca2+)  receptor. For these experiments, we made fura 2-based measurements of cytosolic  [Ca2+] in single osteoclasts in response to the application of a known Ca2+ receptor  agonist, Ni2+. We first confirmed that activation of the osteoclast Ca2+ receptor by  Ni2+ (5 mM) resulted in a characteristic monophasic elevation of cytosolic [Ca2+].  As shown previously, this response was attenuated strongly by calcitonin at  concentrations between 0.03 and 3 nM but remained intact in response to PEMFs. PEMF  application, however, prevented the inhibitory effect of calcitonin on Ni2+-induced  cytosolic Ca2+ elevation. This suggested that the fields disrupted the interaction  between the calcitonin and Ca2+ receptor systems. In conclusion, we have shown that  electromagnetic fields stimulate bone resorption through an action on the osteoblast  and, by abolishing the inhibitory effects of calcitonin, also restore the  responsiveness of osteoclasts to divalent cations.},

Hypoxia inducible  factor-1{$\alpha$}(HIF-1{$\alpha$}), as a transcription factor under hypoxic conditions, has been  confirmed to participate in cell apoptosis. However, the effect of HIF-1{$\alpha$} on  osteocytes apoptosis and the osteocyte-mediated osteoclast formation remains  elusive. Here, we hypothesized that HIF-1{$\alpha$} was involved in osteocytes apoptosis. Our  results showed that CoCl(2) increased the MLO-Y4 cells apoptosis by upregulating the  proapoptotic gene expression of caspase-3. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of  HIF-1{$\alpha$} decreased the phosphorylation by JNK and the activation of caspase-3 to  inhibit the cell apoptosis in MLO-Y4. Furthermore, SP600125, an inhibitor of JNK,  reversed CoCl(2)-induced the increased apoptosis of MLO-Y4 cells in term of reducing  the expression of caspase-3. These findings revealed that HIF-1{$\alpha$} served as a  pro-apoptotic factor in the apoptosis of MLO-Y4 cells cultured with CoCl(2), by  activating the JNK/caspase-3 signaling pathway. Besides, the osteocyte-mediated  osteoclastogenesis was reduced with the decline of the expression of HIF-1{$\alpha$} and  caspase-3 in MLO-Y4 cells. Our study provided an idea for a more comprehensive  understanding of HIF-1{$\alpha$} and the process of bone remodeling.},

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as an important  regulatory factors on bone metabolism. Here, we discovered a novel lncRNA, Bmcob,  which modulated osteogenic differentiation of primary mouse BMSCs. Expression levels  of Bmcob were significantly upregulated in early-to-mid stages during osteoblast  differentiation. Silencing of Bmcob suppressed osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs  in~vitro, whereas its overexpression protected BMSCs from oxidative stress induced  inhibition on osteogenesis. Subsequently, we discovered that selenoprotein P  (Sepp1), which is located next to the Bmcob gene, was partly responsible for the  regulatory effects of Bmcob. In addition, a series of selenoproteins were  downregulated in BMSCs with Bmcob knockdown. Mechanistically, we found Bmcob was  associated with selenocysteine insertion sequence binding protein 2 (SBP2), a  critical trans-acting factor for selenoprotein synthesis. Finally, we suggest an  explanatory hypothesis that through modulating nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of SBP2,  Bmcob regulates a number of selenoproteins expression, including sepp1, and then  mediates osteogenesis of BMSCs. Taken together, our results revealed a novel  mechanism regulating osteogenesis of BMSCs and may function as a potential target  for treating osteoporosis.},

Although the exact pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated, a central  role for iron is hypothesised. Likewise, in hereditary haemochromatosis joint  destruction is caused by iron overload. A comparison between these types of  arthropathy could provide more insight in the influence of iron in inducing joint  damage. A literature review was performed to compare both disorders with respect to  their clinical and histological characteristics, and preclinical studies on the  influence of iron on different joint components were reviewed. Similarities in the  features of arthropathy in haemochromatosis and haemophilia are cartilage  degeneration, subchondral bone changes with osteophyte and cyst formation, and  osteoporosis. In both disorders synovial inflammation and proliferation are seen,  although this is much more explicit in haemophilia. Other substantial differences  are the age at onset, the occurrence of chondrocalcinosis radiographically and  calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease in haemochromatosis, and a rapid  progression with joint deformity and neovascularisation in haemophilia. Preclinical  studies demonstrate detrimental effects of iron to all components of the joint,  resulting in synovial inflammation and hyperplasia, chondrocyte death, and impaired  osteoblast function. These effects, particularly the synovial changes, are  aggravated in the presence of a pro-inflammatory signal, which is prominent in  haemophilic arthropathy and minimal in haemochromatosis. Additional research is  needed to further specify the role of iron as a specific target in treating these  types of arthropathy.},

Here we show for the first time that selenium nanoparticles, when given in  conjugation to anastrozole, lower the bone toxicity caused by anastrozole and thus  reduce the probable damage to the bone. Selenium nanoparticles at a dose of 5{$\mu$}g/ml  significantly reduced the cell death caused by anastrozole (1{$\mu$}M) in HOS (human  osteoblast) cells. In addition, our results also highlighted that in female SD rat  model, SeNPs (0.25, 0.5, 1mg/kg/day) significantly prevented the decrease in bone  density and increase in biochemical markers of bone resorption induced by  anastrozole (0.2mg/kg/day) treatment. Histopathological examination of the femurs of  SeNP treated group revealed ossification, mineralization, calcified cartilaginous  deposits and a marginal osteoclastic activity, all of which indicate a marked  restorative action, suggesting the protective action of the SeNPs. Interestingly,  SeNPs (1mg/kg/day) also exhibited protective effect in ovariectomized rat model, by  preventing osteoporosis, which signifies that bone loss due to estrogen deficiency  can be effectively overcome by using SeNPs.},

  abstract = {Inadequate serum selenium levels may delay the growth and physiological changes in bone metabolism. In humans, reduced serum selenium concentrations are associated  with both increased bone turnover and reduced bone mineral density. Moreover, a  reduced nutritional intake of selenium may lead to an increased risk of bone  disease. Therefore, selenium is an essential nutrient playing a role in bone health,  probably due to specific selenium-proteins. Some selenium-proteins have an  antioxidation enzymatic activity and participate in maintaining the redox cellular  balance, regulating inflammation and proliferation/differentiation of bone cells  too. At least nine selenium-proteins are known to be expressed by fetal osteoblasts  and appear to protect bone cells from oxidative stress at bone microenvironment.  Mutations of selenium-proteins and reduced circulating levels of selenium are known  to be associated with skeletal diseases such as the Kashin-Beck osteoarthropathy and  postmenopausal osteoporosis. In addition, the intake of selenium appears to be  inversely related to the risk of hip fragility fractures. Recent data suggest that  an altered selenium state may affect bone mass even in males and selenium-proteins  and selenium concentrations were positively associated with the bone mass at  femoral, total and trochanteric sites. However, selenium, but not selenium-proteins,  seems to be associated with femoral neck bone mass after adjustment for many bone  fracture risk factors. The present review summarizes the findings of observational  and interventional studies, which have been designed for investigating the  relationship between selenium and bone metabolism.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Women transitioned to postmenopausal status experience a corresponding gain in iron stores. Recently clinical researches have observed increased serum  ferritin level in postmenopausal women, and ferritin level was negatively correlated  with bone mineral density. PURPOSE: To explore the mechanism of iron-induced  osteopenia in mouse model. METHODS: Briefly, in this study, we established an iron  accumulation mouse model with ovariectomy. Primary osteoclasts and osteoblasts were  extracted for this research. Biomarkers of bone metabolism and cell signaling  pathways were measured. RESULTS: We found that bone mass changed later than ferritin  and decreased gradually following overiectomy. We also observed higher levels of  bone resorption and oxidative stress when iron was administered. When stimulated  with iron, primary osteoclasts derived from bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs)  underwent differentiation and numerous reactive oxygen species (ROS) were generated.  Further, we found that iron activated the JNK, ERK and NF-{$\kappa$}B signaling pathways in  vivo. In vitro, we found that only NF-{$\kappa$}B signaling was stimulated by iron and that  suppression of this pathway blocked osteoclast differentiation. To determine whether  these effects were related to ROS, osteoclasts were treated with H(2)O(2). We found  that ROS stimulated osteoclast activity, and that this effect was reversed upon  NF-{$\kappa$}B suppression. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that ROS might be a downstream  factor of iron and regulated NF-{$\kappa$}B signaling in osteoclasts in mouse model.},

METHODS: Thirty-two SD rats were  randomized into normal control group (8 rats) and osteoporotic group (24 rats), and  osteoporosis was induced in rats of the latter group by intragastric retinoic acid  administration at the daily dose of 80 mg/kg for 15 consecutive days. The  osteoporotic rats were subdivided into control group (8 rats) without treatment,  boron treatment group (8 rats) and estradiol treatment group (8 rats). After 30 days  of treatment, the serum contents of Ca, P, boron and the activities of alkaline  phosphatase (AKP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) in the rats were  assayed, the bone mineral density (BMD) of the whole body, lumbar vertebrae and  tibia were determined, and the morphological changes of the femurs were observed.  RESULTS: The serum contents of Ca and P in the rats of the 4 groups differed  scarcely, but the content of boron in boron treatment group was markedly higher than  that in the other three groups. In the osteoporotic control group, the activities of  serum AKP and TRAP, the masses of spongy bone and cortical bone of the femurs, and  the quantity of the osteoclasts were increased, with the BMD of the lumbar vertebrae  and tibia decreased, suggesting osteoporotic conditions. The mean trabecular plate  density and thickness, trabecular bone volume and cortical bone volume of the femurs  in the osteoporotic rats treated with boron or estradiol were significantly  increased, but the active osteoclast quantity in the spongy bone and serum TRAP  activities were obviously decreased, and the bone quality was comparable with that  of the normal group. In addition, the serum AKP activity and the active osteoblast  quantity in the spongy bone were obviously increased in boron treatment group.  CONCLUSION: The dietary boron supplement can increase the serum content of boron of  osteoporotic rats to stimulate bone formation and inhibit bone resorption, producing  therefore obvious therapeutical effect against osteoporosis.},

Bone growth retardation is a common finding in various conditions  associated with dietary zinc deficiency. Bone zinc content has been shown to  decrease in aging, skeletal unloading, and postmenopausal conditions, suggesting its  role in bone disorder. Zinc has been demonstrated to have a stimulatory effect on  osteoblastic bone formation and mineralization; the metal directly activates  aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, a rate-limiting enzyme at translational process of  protein synthesis, in the cells, and it stimulates cellular protein synthesis. Zinc  has been shown to stimulate gene expression of the transcription factors  runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) that is related to differentiation into  osteoblastic cells. Moreover, zinc has been shown to inhibit osteoclastic bone  resorption due to inhibiting osteoclast-like cell formation from bone marrow cells  and stimulating apoptotic cell death of mature osteoclasts. Zinc has a suppressive  effect on the receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB ligand  (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis. Zinc transporter has been shown to express in  osteoblastic and osteoclastic cells. Zinc protein is involved in transcription. The  intake of dietary zinc causes an increase in bone mass. beta-Alanyl-L: -histidinato  zinc (AHZ) is a zinc compound, in which zinc is chelated to beta-alanyl-L:  -histidine. The stimulatory effect of AHZ on bone formation is more intensive than  that of zinc sulfate. Zinc acexamate has also been shown to have a potent-anabolic  effect on bone. The oral administration of AHZ or zinc acexamate has the restorative  effect on bone loss under various pathophysiologic conditions including aging,  skeletal unloading, aluminum bone toxicity, calcium- and vitamin D-deficiency,  adjuvant arthritis, estrogen deficiency, diabetes, and fracture healing. Zinc  compounds may be designed as new supplementation factor in the prevention and  therapy of osteoporosis.},

Osteoporosis, which is induced with its accompanying decrease in bone mass with increasing age, is  widely recognized as a major public health problem.

There is growing evidence that nutritional and food factors may play a part in the  prevention of bone loss with aging and have been to be worthy of notice in the  prevention of osteoporosis. Zinc, an essential trace element, or genistein, which  are contained in soybeans, has been shown to have a stimulatory effect on  osteoblastic bone formation and an inhibitory effect on osteoclastic bone  resorption, thereby increasing bone mass.

The  oral administration of those factors has been shown to prevent on bone loss in  ovariectomized rats, an animal model for osteoporosis, indicating a role in the  prevention of osteoporosis.

  abstract = {Postmenopausal osteoporosis is characterized by an imbalance of bone resorption exceeding bone formation, resulting in a net loss of bone mineral density (BMD).  Estrogen deficiency is known to promote bone resorption. However, the causative  factors that impair bone formation have not been identified. Women after menopause  experience not only estrogen deficiency but also iron accumulation as a result of  cessation of menstruation. In this study we investigated whether increased iron  plays a role in osteoporosis. By growing primary mouse osteoclast and osteoblast  progenitor cells as well as immortalized cell lines in the presence of iron, we  found that increased iron had minimal effects on osteoclast cell differentiation.  Interestingly, iron, particularly in its inorganic form, and to a lesser extent  ferritin and transferrin all suppressed alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities in  osteoblasts. Moreover, iron downregulated mRNA levels of several other  osteoblastogenic markers such as Runx2, osterix, osteopontin, and osteocalcin. To  further show that this in vitro finding is relevant to the in vivo condition, we  demonstrated that iron-accumulated mice with intact ovaries exhibited a significant  decrease in BMD. Although iron inhibited preosteoblast cell differentiation, it did  enhance preosteoblast cell proliferation, as evidenced by increased cell growth and  expression of cell cycle regulator genes such as CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D1, and cyclin  D3 and G(2) /M phase cell population. Taken together, our results suggest that  increased iron could be a factor that slows down bone formation in postmenopausal  women.},

Evaluating the  effects of SMFs on bone cell (especially osteoblast) function and exploring the  mechanism, which is critical for understanding the possible risks or benefits from  SMFs to the balance of bone remodeling. Iron and magnetic fields have the natural  relationship, and iron is an essential element for normal bone metabolism. Iron  overload or deficiency can cause severe bone disorders including osteoporosis.  However, there are few reports regarding the role of iron in the regulation of bone  formation under SMFs. In this study, hypomagnetic field (HyMF) of 500~nT, moderate  SMF (MMF) of 0.2~T, and high SMF (HiMF) of 16~T were used to investigate how  osteoblast (MC3T3-E1) responses to SMFs and iron metabolism of osteoblast under  SMFs. The results showed that SMFs did not pose severe toxic effects on osteoblast  growth. During cell proliferation, iron content of osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells was  decreased in HyMF, but was increased in MMF and HiMF after exposure for 48~h.  Compared to untreated control (i.e., geomagnetic field, GMF), HyMF and MMF exerted  deleterious effects on osteoblast differentiation by simultaneously retarding  alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, mineralization and calcium deposition. However,  when exposed to HiMF of 16~T, the differentiation potential showed the opposite  tendency with enhanced mineralization. Iron level was increased in HyMF, constant in  MMF and decreased in HiMF during cell differentiation. In addition, the mRNA  expression of transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) was promoted by HyMF but was inhibited  by HiMF. At the same time, HiMF of 16~T and MMF of 0.2~T increased the expression of  ferroportin 1 (FPN1). In conclusion, these results indicated that osteoblast  differentiation can be regulated by altering the strength of the SMF, and iron is  possibly involved in this process.},

Our research group previously fabricated B-mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG)  scaffolds, which successfully promoted osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts  when compared to pure MBG scaffolds without boron. However, the mechanisms of the  positive effect of B-MBG scaffolds on osteogenesis remain unknown. Therefore, we  performed in-vivo experiments in OVX rat models with pure MBG scaffolds and compared  them to B-MBG scaffold. As a result, we found that B-MBG scaffold induced more new  bone regeneration compared to pure MBG scaffold and examined genes related to bone  regeneration induced by B-MBG scaffold through RNA-seq to obtain target genes and  epigenetic mechanisms. The results demonstrated an increased expression and  affiliation of Setd7 in the B-MBG group when compared to the MBG group.  Immunofluorescent staining from our in vivo samples further demonstrated a higher  localization of Setd7 and H3K4me3 in Runx2-positive cells in defects treated with  B-MBG scaffolds. KEGG results suggested that specifically Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin signaling  pathway was highly activated in new bone area associated with B-MBG scaffolds.  Thereafter, in vitro studies with human bone marrow stem cells (hBMSCs) stimulated  by extracted liquid of B-MBG scaffolds was associated with significantly elevated  levels of Setd7, as well as H3K4me3 when compared to MBG scaffolds alone. To verify  the role of Setd7 in new bone formation in the presence of Boron, Setd7 was knocked  down in hBMSCs with stimulation of the extracted liquids of B-MBG or MBG scaffolds.  The result showed that osteoblast differentiation of hBMSCs was inhibited when Setd7  was knocked down, which could not be rescued by the extracted liquids of B-MBG  scaffolds confirming its role in osteoblast differentiation and bone regeneration.  As a histone methylase, Setd7 may be expected to be a potential epigenetic target  for new treatment schemes of osteoporosis. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE:  Boron-containing MBG scaffold has already been proved to promote bone regeneration  in femoral defects of OVX rats by our research group, however, the epigenetic  mechanism of Boron's positive effects on bone generation remains ill-informed. In  our present study, we found an increased expression and affiliation of Setd7 and  H3K4me3 in Runx2-positive osteoblasts in vivo. And in vitro, the higher expression  of Setd7 enhanced osteogenic differentiation of human BMSCs stimulated by extracted  liquids of B-MBG scaffold compared to MBG scaffold, which was associated with the  activation of Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin signaling pathway. Above all, it suggests that Setd7  plays an positive role in osteogenic differentiation and it may become a potential  epigenetic target for new schemes for osteoporosis.},

However, the molecular mechanism through which surface coatings exert  the biological activity is not fully understood, and the effects have been difficult  to achieve, especially in the osteopenic bone. In this study, We examined the effect  of zinc-modified calcium silicate coatings with two different Zn contents to induce  osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow-derived pericytes (BM-PCs) and  osteogenetic efficiency in ovariectomised rabbits. Ti-6Al-4V with zinc-modified  calcium silicate coatings not only enhanced proliferation but also promoted  osteogenic differentiation and mineralized matrix deposition of rat BM-PCs as the  zinc content and culture time increased in vitro. The associated molecular  mechanisms were investigated by Q-PCR and Western blotting, revealing that  TGF-{$\beta$}/Smad signaling pathway plays a direct and significant role in regulating  BM-PCs osteoblastic differentiation on Zn-modified coatings. Furthermore, in vivo  results that revealed Zn-modified calcium silicate coatings significantly promoted  new bone formation around the implant surface in osteopenic rabbits as the Zn  content and exposure time increased. Therefore, Zn-modified calcium silicate  coatings can improve implant osseointegration in the condition of osteopenia, which  may be beneficial for patients suffering from osteoporosis-related fractures.},

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells and  precursors to osteoblasts. MSCs play an important role in OP. Therefore, we  evaluated the correlation between MSCs and OP in an environment of iron  accumulation. Serum P1NP was decreased in iron accumulation mice. Micro-CT revealed  that iron accumulation decreased bone mineral density and spatial structural  parameters. Iron accumulation inhibited MSC quantity in bone marrow. However, the  iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) rescued the suppression. Iron accumulation also  changed the MSC cell cycle. Iron elevated MSC cell ROS level and NOX4 protein  expression. MSC apoptosis was increased, and more caspase3 was cleaved after iron  intervention. Our data suggests that iron accumulation inhibits MSC quantity and  induces MSC apoptosis. Bone loss from iron accumulation may correlate with the  inhibition of MSCs.},

  abstract = {Hemochromatosis is a known cause of osteoporosis, and iron overload has deleterious effects on bone. Although iron overload and its association with osteoporosis has  long been recognized, the pathogenesis and exact role of iron have been undefined.  Bone is an active tissue with constant remodeling capacity. Osteoblast (OB)  development and maturation are under the influence of core binding factor alpha-1  (CBF-alpha1), which induces expression of OB-specific genes, including alkaline  phosphatase, an important enzyme in early osteogenesis, and osteocalcin, a  noncollagenous protein deposited within the osteoid. This study investigates the  mechanism by which iron inhibits human OB activity, which in vivo may lead to  decreased mineralization, osteopenia, and osteoporosis. We demonstrate that  iron-provoked inhibition of OB activity is mediated by ferritin and its ferroxidase  activity. We confirm this notion by using purified ferritin H-chain and  ceruloplasmin, both known to possess ferroxidase activity that inhibited  calcification, whereas a site-directed mutant of ferritin H-chain lacking  ferroxidase activity failed to provide any inhibition. Furthermore, we are reporting  that such suppression is not restricted to inhibition of calcification, but  OB-specific genes such as alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and CBF-alpha1 are all  downregulated by ferritin in a dose-responsive manner. This study corroborates that  iron decreases mineralization and demonstrates that this suppression is provided by  iron-induced upregulation of ferritin. In addition, we conclude that inhibition of  OB activity, mineralization, and specific gene expression is attributed to the  ferroxidase activity of ferritin.},

Deficiency of these elements can cause severe bone disorders including osteoporosis.  However, there are few reports regarding the role of mineral elements in the  regulation of bone formation under SMFs. In this study, hypomagnetic field (HyMF) of  500 nT, moderate SMF (MMF) of 0.2 T, and high SMF (HiMF) of 16 T were used to  investigate the effects of SMFs on mineral element (calcium, copper, iron,  magnesium, manganese, and zinc) alteration of MC3T3-E1 cells during osteoblast  mineralization. The results showed that osteoblasts in differentiation accumulated  more mineral elements than non-differentiated cell cultures. Furthermore, HyMF  reduced osteoblast differentiation but did not affect mineral elements levels  compared with control of geomagnetic field. MMF decreased osteoblast differentiation  with elevated iron content. HiMF enhanced osteoblast differentiation and increased  all the mineral contents except copper. It is suggested that the altered potential  of osteoblast differentiation under SMFs may partially due to the involvement of  different mineral elements.},

Given its wide range etiologies, it  is crucial to establish an animal model of osteoporosis for use in screening  potential drugs quickly and effectively. Previous research has reported that an  accumulation of elevated iron in the body is an independent risk factor for  osteoporosis. As such, we sought to use both zebrafish larvae and adults to model an  osteoporosis phenotype using high iron stress (FAC, ferric ammonium citrate).  Skeletal staining results suggested that iron-overload caused a significant decrease  in bone calcification as well as severe developmental cartilage defects. In  addition, osteoblast and cartilage-specific mRNA expression levels were  downregulated after exposure to a high-iron environment. Most importantly, we  demonstrated in both larval and adult fish that high iron-induced osteogenic defects  were significantly rescued using alendronate (AL), a drug known to be effective  against to human osteoporosis. Even more, the repair effect of AL was achieved by  facilitating osteoblast differentiation and targeting Bmp signaling. Taken together,  our findings propose an rapid and effective osteoporosis model, which could be used  widely for future osteoporosis drug screening.},

Our results show that hepcidin levels  negatively correlate with bone loss in both knockout and overexpression (with  ovariectomy) murine models. In addition, iron overload enhances reactive oxygen  species (ROS) activity and attenuates the functions of primary osteoblasts, while  iron depletion could reverse this phenomenon through inhibiting the functions of  primary osteoclasts. Therefore, our results provide more evidence of the 'iron  accumulation' hypothesis, which suggests that high iron levels are risk factors for  osteoporosis, and the 'Huang's hypothesis' that hepcidin is a potential drug target  for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis.},

This study aims to ascertain the  involvement of miR-455-3p and its underlying mechanisms in osteoporosis. METHODS:  The osteoblast cell lines MC3T3-E1 was treated with ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) to  mimic a pathological environment for osteoporosis. The cytotoxic effect of iron  overload was assessed by proliferation, apoptosis and oxidative stress of  osteoblasts using commercial kits. Molecular biological methods, including qRT-PCR  analysis, cell transfection and luciferase reporter assays were used to explain the  role of miR-455-3p and its potential mechanisms in osteoblast apoptosis. RESULTS:  FAC dramatically inhibited the proliferation of osteoblast cells MC3T3-E1 but  increased the apoptosis. We also observed that FAC significantly down-regulated  miR-455-3p in MC3T3-E1 cells but enhanced HDAC2 protein level. Moreover, miR-455-3p  overexpression eliminated the effects of iron overload on osteoblast cell  proliferation, apoptosis and oxidative stress. In addition, miR-455-3p regulated  osteoblast cell proliferation, apoptosis and oxidative stress through regulating  HDAC2-Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway. MiR-455-3p overexpression alleviated the oxidative  stress injury in osteoporosis mice. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that  miR-455-3p activated Nrf2/ARE signal pathway through suppressing Keap1 via negative  regulating HDAC2 protein level, thereby suppressing oxidative stress and promoting  osteoblasts growth.},

Iron overload can disrupt bone homeostasis by significant inhibition of osteogenic  differentiation and stimulation of osteoclastogenesis, consequently leading to  osteoporosis. Iron accumulation is also involved in the osteoporosis induced by  multiple factors, such as estrogen deficiency, ionizing radiation, and mechanical  unloading. Iron chelators are first developed for treating iron overloaded  disorders. However, growing evidence suggests that iron chelators can be potentially  used for the treatment of bone loss. In this review, we focus on the therapeutic  effects of iron chelators on bone loss. Iron chelators have therapeutic effects not  only on iron overload induced osteoporosis, but also on osteoporosis induced by  estrogen deficiency, ionizing radiation, and mechanical unloading, and in  Alzheimer's disease-associated osteoporotic deficits. Iron chelators differently  affect the cellular behaviors of bone cells. For osteoblast lineage cells (bone  mesenchymal stem cells and osteoblasts), iron chelation stimulates osteogenic  differentiation. Conversely, iron chelation significantly inhibits osteoclast  differentiation. These different responses may be associated with the different  needs of iron during differentiation. Fibroblast growth factor 23, angiogenesis, and  antioxidant capability are also involved in the osteoprotective effects of iron  chelators.},

  abstract = {Osteoporosis is a progressive systemic disease characterized by low bone mineral density and deterioration of bone microarchitecture. The current therapies are  effective to prevent further bone loss and fractures but they are accompanied by  undesirable side effects and cost issues. The discovery of Chinese herbal medicines  with osteoprotective effects provides alternative treatments to prevent bone loss  without causing severe side effects. Artemisinin (ARS) and its related compounds  have been clinically used as antimalarial agents. Interestingly, their bioactivity  is not limited to antimalarial treatment. Experimental evidences indicate that ARS  compounds are a potential type of therapeutic alternative medicine for bone loss  induced by accelerated osteoclastic bone resorption. The present review intends to  summarize the current understandings of ARS compounds and their molecular mechanisms  of actions in preventing bone loss. ARS compounds selectively inhibit osteoclast  differentiation by downregulation of pathways involved in receptor activator of  nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) -induced osteoclastogenesis, and have no  effect on osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts. The exact mechanism of  activation and action of these anti-resorption effects are not fully elucidated.  Considering the characteristic of high levels of intracellular iron in osteoclasts,  ARS compounds may inhibit osteoclast differentiation via mechanisms associated with  intracellular iron, including the cleavage of endoperoxide bridge, oxidative damage  and ferroptosis. The anti-resorptive effects of ARS compounds need to be further  investigated in bone loss models caused by different factors, and to be under  clinical development.},

We recently found that hepcidin can increase  intracellular iron and calcium levels and promote mineralization in osteoblasts. The  present study was designed to evaluate the effects of hepcidin on osteoclasts. Our  results showed that mouse hepcidin 1 (MH1) can increase the number of TRAP-positive  MNCs concomitant in both bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and RAW264.7 cells  and upregulate mRNA levels of TRAP, cathepsin K, and MMP-9 and increase TRAP-5b  protein secretion in RAW264.7 cells. Moreover, MH1 can downregulate the level of  FPN1 protein and increase intracellular iron in RAW 264.7 cells. Therefore, we  conclude that MH1 can significantly facilitate osteoclast differentiation in vitro.  The mechanism behind accelerated differentiation may be associated with increased  levels of intracellular iron.

In the present study, we try to investigate the  effects of iron disorder on bone metabolism using Irp2 knockout (Irp2(-/-)) mice.  Female Irp2(-/-) mice were used in this study. Bone mineral density (BMD) was  measured by Micro-CT. Serum markers for bone turnover were measured by enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assay. Content of iron was measured in bone and liver tissue, and  Vitamin D 25-hydroxylase (CYP2R1) content was measured in liver tissue. Relative  gene expression involved in iron export and uptake, and some genes involved in  activities of osteoblast and osteoclast were all measured by real-time PCR and  western blot. Compared to wild-type mice, Irp2(-/-) mice exhibited reduced BMD, bone  iron deficiency, and hepatic iron overload. Serum levels of 25(OH)D(3) and markers  for bone formation such as bone alkaline phosphatase (Balp), bone-gla-protein (BGP),  and type I collagen alpha1 chain (Col I {$\alpha$}(1)) were decreased, while markers for bone  resorption including cathepsin K (Ctsk) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase  (Trap) were all significantly increased. Hepatic CYP2R1 level was decreased in  Irp2(-/-) mice compared with wild-type control mice. Compared to wild-type C57BL6  control mice, the expression of genes involved in osteoblast activity such as Balp,  BGP, and Col I {$\alpha$}(1) were all significantly decreased in bone tissue, while genes for  osteoclast activity such as Ctsk and Trap were all markedly increased in Irp2(-/-)  mice at mRNA level. Genes involved in iron storage, uptake, and exporting were also  measured in bone tissue. Posttranscriptionally decreased ferritin (FTL), ferroportin  1 (FPN1), and increased transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) gene expressions have been  unexpectedly found in bone tissue of Irp2(-/-) mice. Irp2(-/-) mice exhibit reduced  bone iron content and osteoporosis. Decreased circulating 25(OH)D(3) levels promoted  activity of osteoclast, while impaired activity of osteoblast may contribute to  pathogenesis of osteoporosis. And, reduced bone iron content may not be totally  caused by TfR1-dependent pathways.},

  abstract = {Silicon is one of the essential trace elements in the human body; the deficiency of which may lead to bone diseases. Numerous animal experiments have shown that an  appropriate increase in the intake of silicon is beneficial to enhancing bone  density and toughness to prevent osteoporosis. However, the molecular mechanisms of  the silicon-mediated osteogenesis process have not been sufficiently clarified. In  this study, we determined the possible osteogenesis-related mechanisms of  orthosilicic acid at a molecular level. We detected the relevant pathway and  osteogenic indicators by immunofluorescence (IF), Western blot, alkaline phosphatase  (ALP) staining (using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium  [BCIP/NBT]), ALP enzyme labeling method, osteocalcin (OCN), and N-terminal  propeptide of type 1 procollagen (P1NP) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  We found that orthosilicic acid is capable of enhancing the expression of  phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K), phospho-protein kinase B  (P-Akt), phospho-mammalian target of rapamycin (P-mTOR), and related osteogenic  markers (runt-related transcription factor 2 [RUNX2], type I collagen [COL1], ALP,  OCN, and P1NP). However, with the addition of PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway-specific  inhibitor LY294002, the expression of PI3K, P-Akt, P-mTOR, RUNX2, COL1, ALP, OCN,  and P1NP decreased. The results indicated that the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway played a  positive regulatory role in the process of orthosilicic acid-mediated osteogenesis  in vitro.},
