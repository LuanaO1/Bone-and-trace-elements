  abstract = {The objective of this study was to compare the tibial structure and the strength of the tibia during muscle weakness and after recovery in mdx mice (which demonstrate X-linked muscular dystrophy and subsequent muscle regeneration) and age-matched control mice. The extent of disuse atrophy produced by muscle weakness and recovery following restoration of normal muscle strength could then be determined. The tibiae adjacent to weakened tibialis anterior muscles of 4-week-old mdx mice had significantly reduced radiographic density (p {$<$} 0.05) and cortical thickness (p {$<$} 0.001), and increased porosity (p {$<$} 0.001) compared to age-matched controls, suggesting development of disuse osteopenia. Significantly less force was required to break mdx tibiae than age-matched control tibiae (p {$<$} 0.05). In addition, Sharpey's fiber density was reduced (p {$<$} 0.001), suggesting a weakened attachment of the tibialis anterior muscle to bone. At 12 weeks, during the period of muscle regeneration, mdx tibial cortical thickness (p {$<$} 0.001) and porosity (p {$<$} 0.01) remained significantly lower, but percent calcium and Sharpey's fiber and radiographic densities were significantly greater (p {$<$} 0.001) than in age-matched controls, suggesting that bone mineralization and muscle attachment strength had increased to above normal levels in parallel with recovery of strength by the attached muscle. By 18 weeks, mdx tibial cross-sectional area, cortical thickness, and porosity remained significantly less (p {$<$} 0.001) than normal. Although Sharpey's fiber density was greater than in agematched controls (p {$<$} 0.001) by 18 weeks, mdx tibial percent calcium (p {$<$} 0.005) and Sharpey's fiber density (p {$<$} 0.001) were significantly reduced from levels in 12-week-old mdx animals. There was significantly less deformation of the tibia prior to fracture in mdx than control tibiae at 18 weeks of age, suggesting tibial brittleness. Thus, at the site of attachment of mdx muscle to osteopenic bone, the remodelling which accompanies recovery of muscle strength is atypical, and produces an attachment of greater strength than function appears to require. These observations suggest that data are needed regarding bone mass and muscle\textemdash bone attachments in humans with disuse osteopenia, DMD, and other neuromuscular diseases.},

Supplementation of calcium is highly recommended for such conditions. However, the source of calcium plays an important role in the amount of calcium that is assimilated into bone. We hypothesize that naturally occurring coral calcium and zeolite may prevent ovariectomy-induced bone loss. We have measured bone loss in ovariectomized mice supplemented with coral calcium and Zeolite. Female C57BL/6 mice were either sham-operated or ovariectomized and fed diets containing coral calcium or zeolite for 6 months. Serum was analyzed for bone biochemical markers and cytokines. Bones were analyzed using dual x-ray absorbtiometry, peripheral quantitative computed tomography, and micro\textendash computed tomography densitometry. In the distal femoral metaphysis, total bone and cortical bone mass was restored and the endocortical surface was significantly decreased in coral calcium and zeolite fed ovariectomized (OVX) mice. Trabecular number and the ratio of bone volume to total volume was higher in OVX mice after coral calcium and zeolite feeding, while trabecular separation decreased in the different treatment OVX groups. Coral calcium protected bone to a lesser extent in the proximal tibia and lumbar vertebrae. Overall, coral calcium and zeolite may protect postmenopausal bone loss.},

  abstract = {In order to assess the ability of six potential bone graft substitutes to support the growth of human osteoblasts, these cells were grown in culture and then plated onto fragments of the six materials and cultured for a further period of 15 days. Tests to confirm the osteoblastic phenotype of the cells included spectrophotometric alkaline phosphatase assay; Western blotting of secreted osteocalcin, osteonectin, bone sialoprotein, and collagen type I; and mineralization within the cultures provided with a supplemented medium. Cells were seeded onto the materials in 24-well plates (Nunc, NaperviUe, IL) at density levels 12 500 cells/cm2 and 25 000 cells/cm2. Specimens were examined after the 15-day culture period by scanning electron microscopy. At a seeding density of 12 500 cells/cm2 results showed that the human osteoblasts had greatest affinities for demineralized rat bone and demineralized Surgibone\textregistered, whilst few osteoblasts were found attached to Pyrost, Surgibone\textregistered, or coral. The collagen matrix of Callopat\textregistered{} hydrated in the culture media exposing the hydroxyapatite crystals within it, and these became the foci for cell attachment and growth. At a seeding density of 25 000 cells/cm2 the osteoblasts had attached to and proliferated upon the surfaces of all the materials, forming multilayers, with the exception of Surgibone\textregistered. These experiments demonstrated that all the materials, with the exception of nondemineralized SurgiboneR, were biocompatable for human osteoblasts. The final population of osteoblasts on the bone graft substitutes appeared to be influenced by cell plating density, surface topography, and antigenicity of the materials.},

  abstract = {Iliac crest bone biopsies were obtained from 64 normal individuals (41 women and 23 men) aged 19\textendash 90 (mean 48.2) years. Thirty-four were double-labeled with tetracycline before biopsy. The following variables were measured in all biopsies: biopsy core width (C.Wi), absolute (A.Ct.Wi) and fractional (F.Ct.Wi) cortical width, absolute (A.Cn.Wi) and fractional (F.Cn.Wi) cancellous width, cortical porosity (Ct.Po), osteon diameter (On.Dm), Haversian canal diameter (Ha.Ca.Dm), and wall thickness (W.Th). In the tetracycline-labeled biopsies the typical cortical remodeling cycle was reconstructed and the activation frequency was estimated. A negative cortical bone balance with aging was found in both sexes. In females F.Ct.Wi decreased (p {$<$} 0.02) with aging because of marrow expansion (p {$<$} 0.05). Furthermore, Ct.Po increased (p {$<$} 0.001) because of a decrease in W.Th (p {$<$} 0.01) and an increase in H.Ca.Dm (p {$<$} 0.001). In nudes the negative cortical bone balance with aging was exclusively caused by an increase in Ct.Po (p {$<$} 0.001) partially explained by an expanding H.Ca.Dm (p {$<$} 0.01). The On.Dm increased with aging (p {$<$} 0.01), but surprisingly, no fall in W.Th was observed. Reconstruction of the remodeling cycle did not reveal any significant difference between younger women and men. However, the activation frequency rose from 0.5 per year in premenopausal to 1.0 per year in postmenopausal women (p {$<$} 0.001), giving rise to a high turnover state, an increase in the remodeling space, and thereby the porosity in the cortical bone immediately after menopause. The present study has shown a reduction in cortical bone mass in elderly people, compared with younger, which may be explained by an age-related remodeling unbalance. This reduction is further increased in women in the postmenopausal state because of a postmenopausal accelerated bone turnover.},

  abstract = {Recently, based on a female rat model of human exposure, we have reported that low-level chronic exposure to cadmium (Cd) has an injurious effect on the skeleton. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether the exposure may also affect bone metabolism in a male rat model and to estimate the gender-related differences in the bone effect of Cd. Young male Wistar rats received drinking water containing 0, 1, 5, or 50 mg Cd/l for 12 months. The bone effect of Cd was evaluated using bone densitometry and biochemical markers of bone turnover. Renal handling of calcium (Ca) and phosphate, and serum concentrations of vitamin D metabolites, calcitonin, and parathormone were estimated as well. At treatment with 1 mg Cd/l, corresponding to the low environmental exposure in non-Cd-polluted areas, the bone mineral content (BMC) and density (BMD) at the femur and lumbar spine (L1\textendash L5) and the total skeleton BMD did not differ compared to control. However, from the 6th month of the exposure, the Z score BMD indicated osteopenia in some animals and after 12 months the bone resorption very clearly tended to an increase. The rats' exposure corresponding to human moderate (5 mg Cd/l) and especially relatively high (50 mg Cd/l) exposure dose- and duration-dependently disturbed the processes of bone turnover and bone mass accumulation leading to formation of less dense than normal bone tissue. The effects were accompanied by changes in the serum concentration of calciotropic hormones and disorders in Ca and phosphate metabolism. It can be concluded that low environmental exposure to Cd may be only a subtle risk factor for skeletal demineralization in men. The results together with our previous findings based on an analogous model using female rats give clear evidence that males are less vulnerable to the bone effects of Cd compared to females.},

  abstract = {The effects of low-level lifetime exposure to cadmium (Cd) on the skeleton mineral status and the risk of bone loss in the elderly were studied in an experimental model of human environmental exposure in non-Cd-polluted areas. Young female Wistar rats were exposed to 1 mg Cd/l in drinking water for 24 months. Bone mineral content (BMC), density (BMD) and area of the lumbar spine (L1\textendash L5) and femur, and total skeleton BMD (T-BMD) were measured densitometrically at the baseline and after 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis was evaluated based on the BMD T score and Z score. Osteocalcin (OC) in the serum and total alkaline phosphatase (total ALP) in the serum, cortical and trabecular bone samples as bone formation markers, and C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) in the serum and urine as bone resorption markers were measured. Calcium (Ca) and Cd concentrations in the serum/blood and urine were determined as well. In the Cd-exposed females, the L1\textendash L5 and femur BMC and BMD at all the studied time points were lower compared to control. The exposure to Cd resulted in lower accumulation of peak bone mass, accelerated osteopenia, and enhanced the prevalence of osteoporosis in aged rats. The effect of Cd was more pronounced at the L1\textendash L5 than at the femur. CTX concentration in the urine was decreased after 6 months and next increased compared to control, whereas the urinary loss of Ca was enhanced during the exposure to Cd. After 24 months of the treatment, the serum total ALP activity and the activity of this enzyme in cortical and trabecular bone decreased and serum CTX concentration increased, whereas the concentrations of OC and Ca were unchanged. The study clearly revealed that low-level lifetime exposure to Cd diminishes the accumulation of bone mass during skeletal growth and influences bone metabolism at maturity causing osteopenia, and enhances the age-related bone loss due to high turnover rate leading in consequence to osteoporosis in aged rats. The results together with our previous findings confirm the hypothesis that environmental exposure to Cd may be a risk factor for skeletal diseases.},

Young female Wistar rats were exposed to 1, 5, 50 or 100 mg Cd/l for 12 months. Cd, dose and time dependently, disturbed the mineral status of the lumbar vertebrae as reflected in decreased bone mineral content (BMC) and density (BMD) at the L1\textendash L5 (DEXA technique) and ash weight (AW) of the fourth lumbar vertebral body (L4). However, the changes were too small to be evident radiographically. Cd had no effect on the ratio of nonorganic to organic component content, except for its decrease at the 100 mg Cd/l. Weakness in the mechanical properties (compression test; Instron machine) of the L4 was noted. At the 1 mg Cd/l, a decrease was observed in the deformation at the yield point, with a simultaneous increase in the L4 stiffness, but not in strength (defined by load at yield or ultimate load). In the 5 mg Cd/l group, similar changes took place and a decrease in the ultimate load was evident as well. At the 50 and 100 mg Cd/l, Cd more seriously affected the L4 mechanical properties. At all levels of Cd exposure, the L4 deformities and/or fractures took place. Intact L4 was noted only in the 1 and 5 mg Cd/l groups. The study clearly revealed that chronic exposure to Cd disturbs the L1\textendash L5 mineral status resulting in weakness in its mechanical properties and in turn in vertebral body (cancellous bone) deformities and fractures. The results allow us to conclude that the critical Cd concentration for these effects is very low [about 0.06\textendash 0.09 {$\mu$}g/g dry defatted weight (DW)] and seem to indicate an osteoporotic character of changes. A very important finding of the study is that Cd affects cancellous bone even at low-level intoxication corresponding to the general population exposure. Thus, we hypothesize that environmental exposure to Cd may be a risk factor for the lumbar spine demineralization and increased incidence of vertebral deformities and fractures.},

  abstract = {Objectives: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis to evaluate effects on biochemical markers and urinary excretion of zinc (Zn) of calcitonin therapy. Methods: Patients were required to have a bone mineral density (BMD) of 2.5 S.D. or more below the young adult mean either at the postero-anterior lumbar spine or at the femoral neck. Subjects were eligible for our study if they were 50 years or older, with at least 5 years of menopause, and in good general health as determined by medical history and a routine clinical blood analysis. The patients were randomly assigned to receive intranasal salmon calcitonin (200IU/day; 50 patients) or placebo (50 patients). All patients received supplemental calcium (1000mg/day). Additionally, 40 age-matched, demographically similar, healthy postmenopausal women were also selected as controls. Measurements of cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (uNTx), osteocalcin (sOC), and urinary zinc concentration were done. All parameters were measured before therapy and again after 1, 3 and 6 months. Results: After 3 and 6 months of treatment, a higher decrease of most indices was observed in the calcitonin group. A statistically significant decrease occurred in the levels of sOC, uNTx and uZn after 3 and 6 months in patients receiving calcitonin therapy (P{$<$}0.05). Levels of sOC and uNTx in calcitonin group were significantly different after 3 and 6 months from both placebo and baseline values of calcitonin group (P{$<$}0.05). Levels of sOC, uNTx and uZn decreased about 40, 46 and 37\%, respectively, in calcitonin group at 6 months after the start of treatment. Conclusions: Our study suggests that values of uNTx, uZn and sOC were significantly lower in the patient group than those in control group and in postmenopausal women with osteopororsis, calcitonin reduces the concentrations of uNTx, uZn and sOC.},

  abstract = {Minerals and trace elements are essential for human health, especially during the growing period and old age. Zinc, as an essential element, has been considered necessary for the growth and stimulation of bone formation. Several authors have demonstrated an association between osteoporosis, urinary zinc excretion and high blood zinc levels suggesting that the changes in bone metabolism are the consequences of increased bone reabsorption in osteoporosis. To carry out this study, we selected a group of 62 females with similar characteristics following the inclusion and exclusion pre-established criteria. To make two comparative groups, determination of bone density was made to the initial group and according to these results, we obtained: (1) group A who were 32 postmenopausal healthy women, with a period of at least 3 years since their last menstrual period (LMP) and evidence of osteoporosis made by determination of bone density, and (2) group B who were 30 postmenopausal non-osteoporotic healthy women. From both groups, we obtained blood sampling for the determination of zinc levels. Group A showed higher values (mean{$\pm$}S.D.=2.13{$\pm$}0.41) when compared with group B (mean{$\pm$}S.D.=1.44{$\pm$}0.42) with t value of 6.223 and p{$<$}0.0001. When we compared urinary zinc excretion in both groups, t and p values showed significant differences. We conclude that blood zinc levels and urinary zinc excretion are biochemical markers with high reliability to determine bone reabsorption for the assessment and diagnosis of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.},

  abstract = {Collagen hydrolysates (CH), obtained by an enzymatic hydrolysis process of gelatins, have potential application as oral supplements. Objective: To evaluate the effects of diet supplementation with collagen hydrolysates on bone metabolism markers in postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density. Methods: A randomized double-blind clinical assay with postmenopausal women with osteopenia was planned. The volunteers ingested 10g/day of CH or a placebo for a period of 24 weeks. The bone resorption markers (carboxyl-terminal collagen crosslinks\textemdash CTX) and bone formation markers (osteocalcin\textemdash OSCAL and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase\textemdash BAP) were determined at baseline and at 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. Results: The sample consisted of 35 placebo and 36 treated subjects (aged 57.3{$\pm$}4.8 years and BMI of 27.4{$\pm$}4.5kg/m2). BAP levels showed no significant changes over the time. CTX levels showed a significant increase during the 24 weeks of treatment from 0.40 to 0.48ng/mL in CH group and 0.47 to 0.57ng/mL in placebo group (p{$<$}0.0001). OSCAL levels also showed a increase during the 24 weeks from 24.8 to 29.0ng/mL in CH group and 28.1 to 31.8ng/mL in placebo group (p{$<$}0.001). A comparison of levels of bone markers between CH and placebo group demonstrated no differences. Analysis of variance revealed no significant effect of dietary supplementation with collagen hydrolysates on biochemical bone markers. Conclusions: CH consumption did not produce any effects on bone metabolism as measured by biochemical indices of bone remodeling in postmenopausal women. The majority of patients exhibited inadequate calcium intake, as well as excess body weight.},

The aim was to highlight main outcome quality indicators and to develop a set of key interventions to direct multidisciplinary teams in providing qualitative care. Methods A two-round Delphi approach was used to build consensus on the most important outcome indicators and on 59 interventions identified in existing guidelines on HPN. Comments and interventions newly identified in the first round were co-evaluated in the second round. Results 29 experts from 9 countries completed the two-round Delphi approach. The outcome indicators rated as the most important are 1) incidence of catheter-related infections, 2) incidence of readmission and quality of life (shared second place) and 3) incidence of dehydration. Sixty eight of a total of 89 interventions were considered as important for the quality of care, of which 46 are based on published guidelines and 22 were newly suggested by the Delphi panel. Conclusions Using a two-round Delphi approach, consensus was reached for the majority of interventions concerning HPN patients with benign diseases. This set of 68 interventions could be of use as a starting point for quality-improvement programs.},

  abstract = {No agent yet found when given continuously to the intact, temporally incoherent adult human skeleton can store in it progressively increasing amounts of bone. BMU theory plus clinical observation suggest that such failure derives from approximately equal effects of such agents on both resorptive and formative activity, partly by affecting the naturally coupled activities of already existing osteoclast and osteoblast populations in BMU and partly by affecting BMU activation. However, the BMU theory also suggests that special sequences of therapeutic manipulations can create a positive bone balance in repeatable increments. One such proposal, called the ADFR sequence, involves first briefly pulsing BMU activation. The resorptive and formative activities created by that pulse will occur in step but at predictably different times, that is, they become temporally coherent. Depressing the coherent resorption with a suitable agent during its lifetime, then freeing the skeleton of treatment during the following coherent osteoblastic activity should cause BMU to deposit normal amounts of new bone in smaller than normal holes, resulting in a net surplus or increment. Repeating the sequence should add further increments. Other manipulations of coherent bone cell populations could remove bone or simply alter its turnover speed, as desired. Thus, special sequences of simple pharmacologic actions that have no useful ultimate effects upon global bone balance when delivered continuously and alone to the incoherent skeleton could create a simple new kind of therapy in the coherent skeleton. The concept of manipulating deliberately induced coherent states for therapeutic purposes should generalize to the treatment of many other tissues, cells, and organs that have the requisite properties. Accepting the encouragement provided by early human and animal trials of the idea, time will tell whether it will join numerous disappointing predecessors reviewed elsewhere in this issue or if it will indeed mark a turn away from them toward a more fruitful approach to treatment and prevention.},

  abstract = {Background and objectives Experimental data suggest that trace elements, such as arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and selenium (Se) can influence the bone remodeling process. We evaluated the cross-sectional association between As, Cd, and Se biomarkers with bone mineral density (BMD) measured at the calcaneus, in a representative sample of a general population from Spain. As secondary analyses we evaluated the associations of interest in subgroups defined by well-established BMD determinants, and also conducted prospective analysis of osteoporosis-related incident bone fractures restricted to participants older than 50 years-old. Methods In N~=~1365 Hortega Study participants {$>$}20 years-old, urine As and Cd were measured by inductively coupled-plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS); plasma Se was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) with graphite furnace; and BMD at the calcaneus was measured using the Peripheral Instaneuous X-ray Imaging system (PIXI). As levels were corrected for arsenobetaine (Asb) to account for inorganic As exposure. Results The median of total urine As, Asb-corrected urine As, urine Cd, and plasma Se was 61.3, 6.53 and 0.39~{$\mu$}g/g creatinine, and 84.9~{$\mu$}g/L, respectively. In cross-sectional analysis, urine As and Cd were not associated with reduced BMD (T-score~{$<~$}-1 SD). We observed a non-linear dose-response of Se and reduced BMD, showing an inverse association below \textasciitilde 105~{$\mu$}g/L, which became increasingly positive above \textasciitilde 105~{$\mu$}g/L. The evaluated subgroups did not show differential associations. In prospective analysis, while we also observed a U-shape dose-response of Se with the incidence of osteoporosis-related bone fractures, the positive association above \textasciitilde 105~{$\mu$}g/L was markedly stronger, compared to the cross-sectional analysis. Conclusions Our results support that Se, but not As and Cd, was associated to BMD-related disease. The association of Se and BMD-related disease was non-linear, including a strong positive association with osteoporosis-related bone fractures risk at the higher Se exposure range. Considering the substantial burden of bone loss in elderly populations, additional large prospective studies are needed to confirm the relevance of our findings to bone loss prevention in the population depending on Se exposure levels.},

Accurate techniques for measuring body compartments are available in children such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to assess fat body mass or bioelectrical impedance analysis for body water and lean body mass. Measuring energy expenditure allows for a more accurate monitoring of the patient's energy needs and decreases the risks associated with underfeeding or overfeeding. In clinical practice, the analysis should be longitudinal and take into account situations carrying a risk of malnutrition. Preventive use of nutritional assessment allows nutritional support to be introduced in a timely fashion, thereby avoiding morbidity/mortality and limiting the long-term impact of malnutrition on growth and development.},

Femoral bone was obtained from patients at operation for the treatment of fracture and compared with that of patients with osteoarthrosis and a necropsy control group. The data suggest that there are no major differences in bone elemental composition in patients with fractures compared with the control group. Bone adjacent to joints with osteoarthrosis tends to be less mineralized (per unit trabecular bone volume) than control bone and bone from fracture patients, and has significantly lower concentrations of boron, lead and, zinc. These observations may reflect the more rapid turnover of bone close to the arthritic joint.},

Thus, no single substance by itself can maintain the proper functioning of any biological subsystem; rather, a balanced intake of all necessary nutrients is needed for optimal nutrition of astronauts. Short-term periods of spaceflight (weeks) present no serious problems in terms of nutritional surveillance and planning; eventual body weight losses and energy deficits can easily be sustained on short missions. However, even an increased food supply does not entirely prevent an inflight weight loss. The chapter also reviews the various types and availability of nutrients.

A random population sample of 2025 women aged 48\textendash 59, who underwent spinal and femoral BMD measurement with dual X-ray absorptiometry in Kuopio, Finland during 1989\textendash 1991 formed the study population. Out of these women, 162 women reported LI. The mean dairy calcium intake was 558 mg/day in women with LI and 828 mg/day in other women (p {$<$} 0.0001). The mean spinal BMDs were 1.097 and 1.129 g/cm2 (-2.8\%) (p = 0.016) and the mean femoral BMDs were 0.906 and 0.932 g/cm2 (-2.8\%) (p = 0.012) for the LI and other women, respectively. After adjusting for weight, age, years since menopause, and the history of hormone replacement therapy, these differences changed to -2.7\% (p = 0.016) for the spinal and -2.4\% (p = 0.012) for the femoral BMD, respectively. Dairy calcium intake was an independent determinant of femoral BMD. The addition of calcium intake variables into the multivariate model did not affect the spinal BMD difference, but weakened the femoral BMD difference to -1.9\% (p = 0.075). Our results suggest that LI slightly reduces perimenopausal BMD, possibly through reduced calcium intake.},

To test if long-term low intake of calcium affects bone strength, we examined fracture risks related to LI in women aged 38\textendash 57 years. The 11,619 Finnish women aged 47\textendash 56 years who responded to the baseline postal inquiry of the Kuopio Osteoporosis Risk Factor and Prevention Study in 1989 formed the study population. In all, 896 women reported LI and 1299 women reported a fracture in 1980\textendash 1989.

The fracture risk in general was slightly elevated in women with LI compared with the other women, with an odds ratio (OR) (95\% CI) of 1.33 (1.09\textendash 1.62). However, the fractures at the three most common sites (wrist, ankle, and rib) were not related to LI. In contrast, fractures at the tibia and metatarsal were strongly related to LI with ORs of 3.31 (1.51\textendash 7.24) and 2.84 (1.47\textendash 5.50), respectively. The adjusted OR for nonankle lower body fractures combined was 2.15 (1.53\textendash 3.04), whereas that for all upper body fractures combined was 1.15 (0.88\textendash 1.54).

  abstract = {Osteoporosis is a common metabolic disease characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue. Many factors are involved in the occurrence of osteoporosis. Cadmium can cause both osteomalacia and osteoporosis and these effects have long been investigated through various epidemiological or experimental studies. The present study examines a possible relationship between cadmium nephropathy and its effects on the skeleton in populations living in a polluted area in southeast China. Monophoton absorptiometry was used to measure bone mineral density in the population and the Z score (the number of SD from the difference between the measured bone density of the individual and the group mean value for sex- and age-matched controls) was introduced to define osteoporosis (Z score {$<-$}2). Osteoporosis caused by cadmium exposure was demonstrated in this study on a general population environmentally exposed to cadmium in China. It was found that there were significant differences in the prevalence of osteoporosis among the different urinary cadmium groups ({$\chi$}2=18.84, P=0.0008). The linear trend test gave {$\chi$}2=16.281, P=0.00005. There was a dose\textendash response relationship between cadmium exposure (urinary cadmium) and prevalence of osteoporosis. Of 31 subjects with osteoporosis, 23 subjects were suffering from renal dysfunction. The prevalence of renal dysfunction (74.19\%) was significantly higher than that in those without osteoporosis ({$\chi$}2=16.53, P{$<$}0.001). Stratum analysis was performed to further assess the relationship between bone damage and renal impairment caused by cadmium. There was a significant difference between those with and without tubular damage ({$\chi$}2=19.92, P=0.000) but not in those with and without glomerular damage ({$\chi$}2=0.08, P=0.114). This showed that glomerular dysfunction plays a smaller role than tubular dysfunction in the causation of bone damage. It was found that the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with increasing values of parameters of tubular damage. Osteoporosis caused by cadmium is thus related to kidney dysfunction and especially to tubular damage and its severity but not to glomerular damage. The present study has thus demonstrated the combined adverse effects (osteoporosis and renal dysfunction) caused by environmental exposure to cadmium for the first time in Asia outside the endemic area in Japan.},

One of its problems is its age, and much of the early work undertaken utilized methodology and proofs that are today unacceptable.

  abstract = {Introduction Recent data in morbid obesity surgery have shown that the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass results in a decrease in bone mass. Therefore, we investigated the impact of duodenal exclusion on bone mineralization in respect to newer duodenal preserving operations in morbid obesity surgery. Methods Twelve female minipigs underwent Billroth I (n = 6) or Billroth II (n = 6) reconstruction. Serum parameters were investigated and bone mineral density of the fourth lumbar vertebra was evaluated by quantitative CT scan at monthly intervals over a 1-y period. Calcium absorption was measured as 47calcium-carbonate at 3-mo intervals. Results At the end of the study, the cancellous volumetric bone mineral density (cancvBMD) and the cortical volumetric bone mineral density (cortvBMD) were significantly more decreased in Billroth II (BII) than in Billroth I (BI) reconstructed minipigs (371.86 {$\pm$} 1.61 versus 386.96 {$\pm$} 5.01 mg/cm3; 402.22 {$\pm$} 1.64 versus 410.7 {$\pm$} 2.08 mg/cm3; both P {$<$} 0.05). Similar distribution was measured for cancellous and cortical bone mineral content (670.0 {$\pm$} 7.5 versus 712.8 {$\pm$} 11.3 mg; 682.2 {$\pm$} 40.5 versus 717.8 {$\pm$} 43.4 mg; both P {$<$} 0.05). Medullary and cortical areas were significantly decreased in BII pigs compared with BI pigs. 47Ca absorption was significantly decreased in BII 3 and 6 mo following the operation, then reached values similar to those in BI animals. Conclusion Exclusion of the duodenum from the passage resulted in impaired mineralization of the axial skeleton due to decreased calcium absorption and impaired vertebral bone volume.},

  abstract = {Bone development during puberty and adolescence may influence the later risk of osteoporosis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the three-dimensional development of the lumbar vertebrae is impaired in terms of bone mineral density and temporal control during the pubertal growth spurt when caloric intake is limited. Two groups of prepubertal female G\"ottingen minipigs (each n = 6) were fed either ad libitum (free fed) or with reduced food intake (controlled fed) for 12 months using a standard diet. Apparent volumetric bone mineral densities (vBMD) and size of the 4th vertebra were measured by quantitative CT in monthly intervals. The weight of free-fed animals was 29.5 {$\pm$} 0.9 kg compared to 25.9 {$\pm$} 3.5 kg in the controlled-fed group at the end of the observation period (mean {$\pm$} SD; p {$<$} 0.05). The maximal cross-sectional area of the 4th vertebra was 148.2 {$\pm$} 3.4 mm2 in free-fed animals compared to 143.1 {$\pm$} 6.3 mm2 in controlled-fed animals (P {$<$} 0.05) as both, the cortical and the medullary area were greater in the free-fed group. In contrast, cancellous and cortical bone mineral densities were not different between the two groups; however, maximal densities were reached earlier in the free-fed group. As regards the height of the vertebra, no difference was observed between the groups after 12 months (25.46 {$\pm$} 0.54 mm in controlled fed vs. 25.56 {$\pm$} 0.45 mm in free fed), although the peak height was reached earlier in the free-fed group. In both groups, the maximal growth rate in the cross-sectional direction was reached earlier compared to the longitudinal direction (both P {$<$} 0.05). Growth in the longitudinal direction that occurs in the primary and secondary epiphysis does not appear to depend on caloric intake contrary to the periosteal and endocortical bone generation in the cross-sectional direction. When limited energy is available, the organism seems to preserve the development of normal body height, while accepting reduced strength of the vertebra.},

  abstract = {Toothless (tl), one of four osteopetrotic mutations in the rat, is characterized by few osteoclasts, undetectable bone resorption, and failure of correction by bone marrow transplantation. We recently reported that CSF-1 treatment improves these skeletal problems but that metaphyseal sclerosis persists. In the present study we demonstrate that optimal reduction of the skeletal sclerosis in tl rats following CSF-1 treatment has lower and upper dosage thresholds and that skeletal sclerosis returns after CSF-1 withdrawal. Osteoclasts increase significantly in tl rats after CSF-1 treatment, but compared to untreated normal littermates, histochemical staining for characteristic enzymes and osteoclast number is reduced and no osteoclasts appear in the subepiphyseal areas of long bones. These data are interpreted to mean that there are dosage limits to the beneficial skeletal effects of CSF-1, that persistent sclerosis is related to the failure to restore subepiphyseal osteoclasts, that osteoclast or progenitor populations may be deficient or differ in their responses to CSF-1, and that the defect in tl rats is not merely lack of a circulating, biologically active form of CSF-1.},

Nutritional assessment therefore should be an integral part of the care for every pediatric patient. Routine screening measures for abnormalities of growth should be performed on all pediatric patients. Those patients with chronic illness and those at risk for malnutrition should have detailed nutritional assessments done. Components of a complete nutritional assessment include a medical history, nutritional history including dietary intake, physical examination, anthropometrics (weight, length or stature, head circumference, midarm circumference, and triceps skinfold thickness), pubertal staging, skeletal maturity staging, and biochemical tests of nutritional status. Alternative measures for linear growth assessment (e.g., lower leg and upper arm measures) can be performed on patients unable to stand or who have musculoskeletal deformities. Bone densitometry can be used to assess bone mineralization and the risk of fracture. Nutritionally at risk patients may benefit from determination of resting energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry. The use of age, gender, and disease-specific growth charts is essential in assessing nutritional status and monitoring nutrition interventions. The importance of accurate measurements using trained personnel and appropriate equipment cannot be overemphasized.},

  abstract = {A systematic method has been developed to assess bone resorption, matrix formation, and calcification in a single calvarial culture from 20-day-old chick embryos. The bones were prelabeled with 45Ca by an injection into the egg white before culture. In the last 2 h of incubation, the bones were further labeled with both 3H-proline and 3H-tetracycline. Bone resorption was assessed as 45Ca release into the medium. Collagen synthesis was measured by the incorporation of 3H-proline into collagenase-digestible protein (CDP). Since tetracycline has been commonly used as an in vivo marker for osteoid calcification, we assessed in vitro calcification as the uptake of 3H-tetracycline into bone. By using this method, we studied the effects of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and indomethacin, which inhibits biosynthesis of PGE2, on bone resorption and formation. The cultured bone synthesized approximately 300 ng of PGE2 during every 24 h of incubation, and indomethacin (10-6 M) completely inhibited the synthesis. In indomethacin-treated cultures, \% 45Ca release and the labeling of CDP were significantly reduced. These reductions were not seen when exogenous PGE2 (10-9 M) comparable to its endogenous level was added along with the indomethacin. Furthermore, 10-8 to 10-5 M PGE2 increased \% 45Ca release and the CDP labeling. In addition, the uptake of 3H-tetracycline into the cultured bone was also enhanced by PGE2. In devitalized calvaria, PGE2 had no effect on 3H-tetracycline uptake, suggesting that the stimulative effect of PGE2 was cell-mediated. These data indicate that PGE2 stimulates not only resorption but also formation of bone in vitro. This method may provide a good means for study of the response of bone tissue to various signals influencing bone mass.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate the predictive value of bone mineral measurements by dual photon absorptiometry (DPA) in vitro for strength and ash weight of lumbar vertebral bodies in elderly, otherwise nonselected individuals. The material comprised 46 individuals: 26 males (43\textendash 95 years) and 20 females (63\textendash 95 years) without malignant diseases. Spinal segments, including L2, L3, and L4, were removed en bloc at autopsy. Bone mineral content (BMC) measurements imitating the normal DPA procedure were performed on the segments suspended in a water bath. The segments were measured in toto (BMCT) and remeasured after removal of the posterior elements (BMCB). The second lumbar vertebral body (L2) was then dissected and sawed below the endplates to obtain samples with pianoparallel ends before compression in a materials testing machine. Finally, the bone specimens were incinerated for ash weight estimations. BMCT showed significant correlations to vertebral body ash weight (r = 0.79), compressive strength (load, r = 0.69), and stress (load per unit area, r = 0.47). The correlations were unproved by removing the posterior elements (BMCBash weight, r = 0.86, BMCB-load, r = 0.74, BMCB-stress, r = 0.49). Correction of BMC for differences in vertebral body height (BMC/cm) further increased the correlation coefficients (BMCB/cm-ash weight, r = 0.92, BMCB/cm-load, r = 0.78, BMCB/cm-stress, r = 0.55). We conclude that lumbar BMC is predictive for lumbar vertebral body compressive strength in vitro and ash weight. The correlation coefficient is improved by removing the posterior non-weight-bearing element. Both BMCB and BMCT corrected for vertebral height give a slightly improved correlation for vertebral body compressive strength.},

Methods The new iontophoretic apparatus consists of two parts. The first part consists of two natural-based, chemically modified particles as potential medicines, while the other part is a 3-electrode electrophoretic device based on a new principle. This device `knocks out' Ca2+ and PO43- ions from the particles with its impulse-like positive and negative charges transmitted through its electrodes placed on the skin. The current and the voltage of the electrodes can be adjusted separately in both leads. Subsequently, these `knocked out' ions are channelled into the porotic bones with the help of the 3rd-reference\textendash electrode. Results In our preliminary in vitro studies, we used porcine tissues to test their calcium and phosphate content after iontophoresis; with or without using molecules. This preliminary analysis revealed that both calcium and phosphate ions became incorporated into the bone. Some in vivo data are also presented. Iontophoretic treatment increased speed of sound (SOS) as determined by ultrasonography in ovariectomized rats. Conclusion Our results suggest that topical iontophoresis may be suitable to treat local osteoporosis or bone defects.},

  abstract = {Background \& aims Chronic Intestinal Failure (CIF) is the long-lasting reduction of gut function, below the minimum necessary for the absorption of macronutrients and/or water and electrolytes, such that intravenous supplementation is required to maintain health and/or growth. CIF is the rarest organ failure. Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) is the primary treatment for CIF. No guidelines (GLs) have been developed that address the global management of CIF. These GLs have been devised to generate comprehensive recommendations for safe and effective management of adult patients with CIF. Methods The GLs were developed by the Home Artificial Nutrition \& Chronic Intestinal Failure Special Interest Group of ESPEN. The GRADE system was used for assigning strength of evidence. Recommendations were discussed, submitted to Delphi rounds, and accepted in an online survey of ESPEN members. Results The following topics were addressed: management of HPN; parenteral nutrition formulation; intestinal rehabilitation, medical therapies, and non-transplant surgery, for short bowel syndrome, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and radiation enteritis; intestinal transplantation; prevention/treatment of CVC-related infection, CVC-related occlusion/thrombosis; intestinal failure-associated liver disease, gallbladder sludge and stones, renal failure and metabolic bone disease. Literature search provided 623 full papers. Only 12\% were controlled studies or meta-analyses. A total of 112 recommendations are given: grade of evidence, very low for 51\%, low for 39\%, moderate for 8\%, and high for 2\%; strength of recommendation: strong for 63\%, weak for 37\%. Conclusions CIF management requires complex technologies, multidisciplinary and multiprofessional activity, and expertise to care for both the underlying gastrointestinal disease and to provide HPN support. The rarity of the condition impairs the development of RCTs. As a consequence, most of the recommendations have a low or very low grade of evidence. However, two-thirds of the recommendations are considered strong. Specialized management and organization underpin these recommendations.},

  abstract = {Individuals diagnosed with Crohn's disease are at an increased risk for developing low bone density. The exact cause of low bone mineral density in Crohn's disease patients has not been determined. The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence of low bone mineral density in premenopausal women with Crohn's disease and to determine the role diet plays in bone mineral density for this population. Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine (L2-L4), proximal femur, and forearm was measured in 51 female controls and 50 females with Crohn's disease using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (Lunar DPX-Plus, Madison, WI). Dietary intake for all Crohn's disease participants was analyzed using both 3-d dietary records and a food frequency questionnaire. When compared to healthy controls, bone mineral density values of Crohn's disease participants were decreased for all sites, particularly the spine (1.169 {$\pm$} 0.114, p = 0.054), Ward's area (0.831 {$\pm$} 0.128, p = 0.052), and the femoral neck (0.927 {$\pm$} 0.100, p = 0.01). Factors associated with lower bone density in Crohn's participants were weight, corticosteroid usage, length and age of diagnosis, history and length of resection, and dietary intakes of magnesium, copper, magnesium, vitamin K, and zinc. The results of this study indicate for the first time that diet plays a role in the development of low bone density in premenopausal women with Crohn's disease.},

The exercise group of 30 rats was divided into 2 groups of 15 rats each, one that was fed a diet supplemented with 50 mg/kg of boron in the form of Na2B4O7 and other that, did not receive a boron supplement. The length and weight were determined in the femur and fifth lumbar vertebra and the bone mineral content and density were assessed through densitometry, and trabecular bone volume, trabecular number, trabecular thickness, and trabecular separation with histomorphometry. The femur lenght and weight, and vertebra weight, and femur and vertebra bone mineral content and density were significantly lower and the trabecular separation was higher in the exercise group than in the others (p {$<$} 0.005 in all). The femur weight, bone mineral content and density, trabecular bone volume and trabecular thickness, were significantly higher in the exercise plus boron group (p {$<$} 0.005 to 0.0001). It was concluded that boron preserves bone mass in rats that have been exposed to intense exercise.},

  abstract = {Strenuous endurance exercise can adversely affect the mechanical integrity of immature bone, but it is unclear whether a more moderate exercise regimen would have a positive effect. Thus, to investigate the response of immature trabecular bone to moderate exercise, we randomly assigned female Sprague-Dawley rats (8 weeks old) to either a basal-control, exercise, or age-matched control group. The basal-control rats were killed at 8 weeks of age, while the other two groups were killed at 18 weeks of age. Between 8 and 18 weeks, one group remained sedentary, while another group was trained progressively on a motor-driven treadmill at a moderate level of intensity. Rat femoral necks (FN) were tested in cantilever bending to failure, and the sixth lumbar vertebral bodies (L6) were compressed to 50\% of their initial height. Both tissues were analyzed for calcium, hydroxyproline, and collagen-crosslinking concentrations, and for changes in geometry. The adrenal mass per unit body mass was significantly greater in the exercised group, compared to the age-matched controls. L6 calcium content, compressional stress, and elastic modulus were significantly less in the exercise group as compared to the age-matched control group. Nonreducible collagen crosslinks (hydroxylysylpyridinoline [HP] and lysylpyridinoline [LP]) were significantly greater in the older exercise and age-matched control L6 and FN. In the weightbearing FN\textemdash but not L6\textemdash the LP concentration of the exercise group was significantly greater than the age-matched controls. FN hydroxyproline concentrations were less and FN fracture angles were different than age-matched controls, but FN mechanical properties were not affected significantly by the exercise regimen. These responses to moderate exercise suggest an intricate interplay between local mechanical effects and systemic factors that drive the adaptations in the bone.},

  abstract = {Both adequate nutrition and exercise are essential for development of peak adult bone mass and maintenance of bone during aging. The optimal dietary level of a nutrient may vary from individual to individual and may change with age, intake of other nutrients, disease, drug therapy, or sex hormone status. Effects on spinal trabecular bone may not parallel effects on axial cortical bone. Calcium nutrition is important in the prevention of osteoporosis, as calcium is a major constituent of bone. The intake of calcium among most American adults is below the levels recommended by public health agencies. There have been no adequate prospective studies to determine the optimal intake of calcium for preservation of bone mass in young or middle-aged adults, although calcium balance studies indicate that premenopausal women require approximately 1,000 mg of calcium per day. The negative calcium balance of early menopause may be ameliorated by 1,000 mg of calcium per day; however, there is no proof that greater intakes fully reverse the effects of estrogen deficiency. Calcium requirements of both elderly men and women are likely to be greater (between 1,000 and 1,500 mg per day) due to an age-related decrease in the efficiency of intestinal calcium absorption. The optimal level of weight-bearing exercise for maintenance of bone mass in old age is probably similar to that of an active young adult. Maintenance of this activity level in middle and old age improves bone mass. An exercise prescription for elderly individuals must include an appraisal of cardiovascular and muscular-skeletal health and be designed to minimize the risk of trauma during exercise.},

  abstract = {Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) was introduced as a treatment modality in the early 1970s primarily for the treatment of chronic intestinal failure in patients with benign disease. The relatively low morbidity and mortality associated with HPN has encouraged its widespread use in western countries. Thus there is huge clinical experience, but there are still few controlled clinical studies of treatment effects and management of complications. The purpose of these guidelines is to highlight areas of good practice and promote the use of standardized treatment protocols between centers. The guidelines may serve as a framework for development of policies and procedures.Summary of statements: Home Parenteral Nutrition (HPN) in adult patientsSubjectRecommendationsGradeNumberIndicationsHome parenteral nutrition support should be used in patients who cannot meet their nutritional requirement by enteral intake, and who are able to receive therapy outside an acute care setting.B1.1Incurable cancer patients may enter a HPN program if they are unable to meet their nutritional requirements by oral or enteral route and there is a risk of death due to malnutrition. It is not a contraindication for HPN that oncologic treatment has been stopped.C1.2HPN is not recommended for patients with incurable disease and a short life-expectancy.C1.3The nutrition support team in HPNThe expertise of a nutrition support team (NST) is recommended for HPN.C2Prescription of HPNThe electrolyte composition of the HPN regimen should reflect fluid losses.C3.1.1The total calories should normally be 20\textendash 35kcal/kg per day.C3.1.3.1The non-protein energy provision should be 100\textendash 150kcal for every gram of nitrogen in the HPN.C3.1.4.1The unstressed adult HPN patient will require 0.8\textendash 1.0g amino acids/kg per day.For long-term HPN treatment ({$>$}6months) the provision of intravenous lipid should not exceed 1g/kg per day. Essential fatty acids should be supplied.C3.1.6.1The daily requirement for essential fatty acids is 7\textendash 10g, which corresponds to 14\textendash 20g LCT fat from soya oil and 30\textendash 40g LCT fat from olive/soya oil.MCT/LCT and fish oil emulsions also appear safe and effective.Intravenous catheters and devicesTunneled central catheters are used, as permanent access is required for long-term parenteral nutrition.C4Implanted ports are an acceptable alternative.PICC-lines are intended for shorter-term use and cannot be recommended for HPN patients.Cyclic administration of parenteral nutrition is recommended.B4.1The use of infusion pumps is recommended, but is not practiced in all European countries.B4.3Improving prognosis in HPNPrognosis in HPN is mainly governed by the underlying disease, but poor outcomes related to the HPN itself come from problems with catheters and the associated vessels. It is important to preserve lines and to protect the vessels as best possible. Reference should be made to the ESPEN guidelines on central venous catheters. In line sepsis in HPN a conservative approach with antibiotics is normally advocated before removing the catheter.C5Education and trainingThere should be a formal teaching program for the patient and/or carer. The teaching program should include catheter care, pump use, and preventing, recognizing and managing complications. Experienced nurses are usually best placed to take responsibility for the teaching program.C5The use of specific brochures or videotapes for teaching, and affiliation with national support organizations, are associated with better outcomes.C5.1Training is usually carried out in an in-patient setting, but training at home can be consideredC5.2MonitoringBiochemistry and anthropometry should be measured at all visits; measurement of trace elements and vitamins are recommended at intervals of 6months. Bone mineral density assessment by DEXA scanning is recommended at yearly intervals.C6Liver disease in HPNHPN-associated liver disease is related to the composition of the HPN and to the underlying disease or coexisting liver disease. The fat/glucose energy ratio should not exceed 40:60 and lipids should comprise no more than 1g/kg per day.B7All forms of over-feeding should be avoided.B7Glucose administration in excess of 7mg/kg per min, and continuous HPN are also considered risk factors.Prevention of chronic cholestasis is of utmost importance. Infections, in particular line sepsis must be promptly controlled to help prevent deterioration of any liver abnormalities.B7.1Management of underlying diseaseUnderlying disease related factors must be strictly controlled, by treating inflammation and minimizing the dosage of bone damaging drugs.C7.1Optimization of the nutrient admixture during chronic careAluminum contamination of HPN should be less than 25{$\mu$}g/lThe amount of sodium should be no more than required, to avoid sodium induced hypercalciuriaThe calcium, magnesium and phosphate content of the HPN should maintain normal serum concentrations and 24-h urinary excretion.The recommended ratio is 1mmol of calcium to 1mmol of phosphate.The amount of amino acids prescribed should not be greater than losses, in order to limit hypercalciuria.B8.1The recommended intravenous dose of vitamin D is 200IU/day.C8.2Consider vitamin D withdrawal in patients with low bone mineral density (BMD), low serum parathyroid hormone, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations associated with normal 25-hydroxivitamin D.Reducing infusion rates may decrease hypercalciuria.Bisphosphonates (such as clodronate 1500mg iv or pamidronate 20mg iv every 3months), may maintain BMD in patients with osteopenia.B8.3Intestinal transplantation in HPN patientsThe indication for intestinal transplantation is irreversible, benign, chronic intestinal failure associated with life-threatening complications of HPN. Present data do not support direct referral for intestinal transplantation of patients with high risk of death due to underlying disease, chronic dehydration or significantly impaired quality of life. In all patients an individual case-by-case decision is required.B11.1The timing of patient referral is key to obtaining best graft and patient survival. Early referral is recommended to minimize mortality from HPN related complications whilst on the waiting list.C11.2The highest survival rates are observed among younger individuals, those at home rather than in hospital, and in patients managed in experienced transplant centers. There has been steady improvement in patient and graft survival.B11.2},

Some of the effects are nongenomic, since incubation of isolated membrane fractions with the metabolites results in regulation of enzyme activities comparable to that seen in culture. This study examined whether changes in membrane fluidity might be one mechanism involved in the nongenomic regulatory pathway. Chondrocyte cultures were incubated with the vitamin D metabolites and changes in plasma membrane fluidity monitored using the fluorophore, TMA-DPH, which is specific for membranes exposed to external fluids. Isolated matrix vesicles were also incubated directly with the metabolites and anisotropy of the membrane, as well as alkaline phosphatase-specific activity, determined. 1,25-(OH)2D3 caused a rapid and constant increase in alkaline phosphatase-specific activity in GC matrix vesicles; 24,25-(OH)2D3 caused an increase in RC matrix vesicle enzyme activity that was both dose- and time-dependent. Matrix vesicles produced by GC had a lower degree of fluidity than their parent plasma membranes or RC plasma membranes and matrix vesicles. Fluidity of the GC membrane fractions was increased by 1,25-(OH)2D3 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. 1,25-(OH)2D3 had no effect on the fluidity of the RC membranes. 24,25-(OH)2D3 caused a decrease in fluidity in GC at later time points. This metabolite caused an increase in fluidity of RC plasma membranes that returned to normal levels by 6 h; however, the increase induced in the matrix vesicles remained elevated throughout the 24-h experimental period. The results demonstrate that vitamin D metabolites can alter membrane fluidity in a cell-, metabolite-, and membrane-specific manner. For GC matrix vesicles, 1,25-(OH)2D3-dependent increased fluidity correlates with increased alkaline phosphatase activity. While 24,25-(OH)2D3 increases enzyme activity, the relation of this increase to changes in fluidity is less clear, supporting previous observations concerning differential specificity of response to the two metabolites in growth plate chondrocytes.},

In this article, we first review the rationale behind the cycling of Ca isotopes in vertebrate organisms. We then summarize and discuss the use of Ca isotopes as dietary tracers from trophic reconstructions in past vertebrate ecosystems to the tracking of early life dietary transitions. Next, we review and examine the research outcomes on the potential of Ca isotopes as biomarkers of bone loss in physiological and pathological conditions such as bone cancers and osteoporosis. While emphasizing the needs of future research in each of these applications, we suggest new potential uses of Ca isotopes in vertebrate biology. Finally, we identify challenges and barriers faced when developing such interdisciplinary projects and suggest how these can be overcome.},

  abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance Achyranthes bidentata Blume (AB) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine for treating osteoporosis and bone fracture. In the current, researches on pharmacological mechanism of AB mostly focused on molecular pathways, knowledge about its metabolic signatures is largely unclear. This study aims to develop an integrative metabolomics and metallomic approach for deciphering the biochemical basis of anti-osteoporosis effects of raw and salt-processed AB. Method Gas chromatography\textendash mass spectrometry (GC\textendash MS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were combined for metabolomic and metallomic profiling of rats serum, liver and kidney derived from the sham group, model group, E2, raw and salt-processed AB treated groups. Meanwhile, micro-CT and biomechanical analysis were carried out to ensure the success of the osteoporosis model and to validate the anti-osteoporosis effect of raw and salt-processed AB. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was employed to screen potential biomarkers and the MetaboAnalyst and KEGG PATHWAY Database were used to investigate the metabolic pathway. Results Raw and salt-processed AB protected the rats against osteoporosis, as evidenced by the restoration of the alkaline phosphatase activity, osteocalcin concentration, urine calcium/creatinine ratio and urine phosphorus/creatinine ratio. The combination of PCA and PLS-DA revealed deviations in ninety-four differential biomarkers between raw AB treated group and model group. The identified biomarkers were primarily engaged in the metabolic pathways including galactose metabolism, urea cycle, arginine and proline metabolism, alanine metabolism, lactose degradation, ammonia recycling and glycine and serine metabolism. The levels of these biomarkers showed significant alterations and a tendency to be restored to normal values in raw and salt-processed AB treated osteoporosis rats. Of note, the levels of trace elements, such as Zn, Se, Mn, Cu and Fe, were elevated after raw and salt-processed AB treatment. Finally, a correlation network diagram was constructed to show the biomarkers perturbed by raw and salt-processed AB. Conclusion Our findings indicate that raw and salt-processed AB has positive effects on osteoporosis rats. Meanwhile, metabolomic and metallomic method coupled with metabolites enrichment analysis and pattern recognition serves as a useful tool for revealing the action mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine.},

To investigate this, we have attempted to further characterise the suppression of bone formation by the potent bone resorption inhibitor 3-amino-1-hydroxypropylidine-1-bisphosphonate (AHPrBP) in ovariectomised adult female rats. To see whether AHPrBP affects the activity of preexisting bone forming surfaces, as opposed to preventing the induction of new forming surfaces, three consecutive fluorochrome labels were administered 3, 10, and 17 days prior to sacrifice. The percentage of trabecular surface covered by first and second labels only (arrested surface), second and third labels only (induction surface), and all three labels (persisting surface) were recorded at the secondary spongiosa of the proximal tibial metaphysis. As expected, ovariectomy increased the proportion of induction surfaces, with AHPrBP preventing this increase. However, AHPrBP also reduced the proportion of persisting surfaces, implying inhibition of the activity of preexisting boneforming surfaces. We conclude that resorption inhibitors such as AHPrBP inhibit bone formation in the rat in a manner which appears inconsistent with the site-specific coupling seen in the adult human skeleton.},

There were no changes in body weight and bone morphology, but significant alteration was noted in the geometry and mechanical parameters, which was Cu-NP-dose dependent. Our study showed an increase in the ultimate load and toughness in Cu-NP-treated rats at the standard concentration. The higher values of the studied parameters prove that there was a change in bone mineralization. Although bone mineral density and content were not changed, bone tissue density and ash increased. The XRD analysis revealed that some peaks did not originate from hydroxyapatite, and they indicated existence of other mineral phases. No studies conducted so far have provided a detailed mechanical X-ray diffraction analysis of bone tissue of growing rats administered with diet containing Cu nanoparticles. This study showed that Cu-NP given in low dose increased mechanical endurance of bone, without the changes in strain and stress compared to low dose of Cu given in traditional form.},

  abstract = {We developed a computer model to simulate the interaction of biological and mechanobiological factors in the development of the cross-sectional morphology of long bones. The model incorporated a strong influence of biologically induced bone formation during early development. In addition, an assumed mechanical loading history during growth and development corresponding to age-related changes in body weight and muscle mass was applied. Based on the bone stress stimulus generated by the assumed loads, mechanically induced apposition and resorption rates were calculated at the periosteal and endosteal surfaces using a previously developed bone modeling theory. These methods successfully emulated the growth-related changes seen in long bone diaphyseal structure as well as changes observed in mature bones during aging. The simulations recreated the rapid increase in bone dimensions during development, stabilizing at maturity, and then the gradual, age-related subperiosteal expansion and cortical thinning. Throughout the growth, development, and aging simulations, the values of the bone radii, area, moments of inertia, and apposition rates corresponded well with measurements documented by other researchers.},

  abstract = {Dose-dependent effects of strontium on osteoblast function and mineralization. Background Strontium-ranelate is now being used in the treatment of osteoporosis in elderly patients. As the majority of these patients already have a decreased renal function they are at an increased risk for accumulation of the element. Recent findings from epidemiologic studies in dialysis patients and experimental data obtained in a chronic renal failure (CRF) rat model established a dose-related multiphasic effect of strontium (Sr) on bone formation. To confirm these in vivo findings an in vitro set-up, consisting of primary rat osteoblast cultures, was applied. Sr was added to the culture medium at concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 20, and 100{$\mu$}g/mL, respectively. Methods Calcium incorporation (index of mineralization) and alkaline phosphatase activity were determined in the medium during the culture period, while at the end of the experiment, nodule formation (mineralized + unmineralized area) was quantified using a digital imaging system. mRNA synthesis of various osteoblast specific genes was assessed by means of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results Compared to the control group (0{$\mu$}g/mL Sr), a significantly reduced nodule formation in the presence of an intact mineralization was found for the lowest 0.5 and 1{$\mu$}g/mL Sr doses, suggesting an impaired in vitro osteoblast differentiation. Both nodule formation and mineralization were normal for the 2 and 5{$\mu$}g/mL doses. For the highest Sr doses (20 and 100{$\mu$}g/mL) a reduced mineralization was observed in the presence of an intact nodule formation indicating an inhibitory effect on the hydroxyapatite formation. The alkaline phosphatase activity reflected the multiphasic pattern of the nodule formation while the calcium incorporation corresponded with the pattern of nodular mineralization. No variations in cell proliferation were found. RT-PCR revealed that Sr interfered with the osteoblast at the level of the mRNA synthesis of several relevant genes. Conclusion Using the proposed in vitro model we confirmed the multiphasic effect of Sr on bone formation previously demonstrated in a CRF rat model. The data presented allow us to suggest that at low concentrations Sr interferes with the bone formation at the level of cell differentiation, whereas at high concentrations the disturbed mineralization in the presence of an intact nodule formation is indicative for a physicochemical interference of Sr with the hydroxyapatite formation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of Jianpi Bushen (JPBS) formula on aromatase inhibitor (AI)-associated bone loss after menopause. METHODS Six-month-old female rats were randomly divided into 6 groups: a sham group, an ovariectomized (OVX) group, an OVX treated with exemestane and 3 OVX groups each treated with a different dose of JPBS formula. Bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar vertebrae, histology, bone markers and serum levels of estrogen were assessed. Furthermore, a cohort study was conducted in 130 postmenopausal women with breast cancer that had undergone treatment with Als. The subjects were given JPBS + caltrate D or caltrate D only, administered orally. BMD at the lumbar vertebrae and femoral neck and bone markers were evaluated in both control and herbal treatment groups at baseline and 12 months. RESULTS Experimental results indicated that a high dose of JPBS significantly increased the trabecular bone area percentage (Tb.Ar \%) and broadened the trabecular thickness (Tb.Th). The JPBS formula enriched the carboxyterrninal propeptide of type ipmcollagen and increased serum estrogen level significantly. The clinical investigation revealed that bone loss was decreased in the group treated with JPBS vs control (BMD T score at lumbar vertebrae, 3.9\% increased vs 14.58\% decreased, respectively, P = 0.004 and BMD T score on femoral neck, 1.8\% decreased vs 22.45\% decreased, respectively, P = 0.008). Besides, JPBS formula elevated N-middle osteocalcin and decreased type I collagen cross-linked C-terminal telopeptide. CONCLUSION JPBS formula prevented aromatase-inhibitor-associated bone loss after menopause by inhibiting bone resorption and promoting bone formation.},

  abstract = {Objective This study was aimed to evaluate the associations of adult heel bone mineral density (BMD) with birth weight and growth parameters at the age of ten years. Methods The analysis data (97178\textendash 178,494 subjects) was derived from the UK Biobank cohort. Birth weight, comparative body size and height size at the age of ten years were determined by self-report. The heel BMD was estimated by the Quantitative Ultrasound Index through the calcaneus. Linear regression analysis was applied to test the associations of adult heel BMD with birth weight and growth parameters at the age of ten years, respectively. Age, sex, body mass index and 10 principle components (PC) of population structure were used as covariates in the regression analysis of total samples. In sex-specific analysis, age, body mass index and 10 PC were used as covariates. Results We observed significant associations of heel BMD with birth weight (b~=~-0.020, P~=~1.974~\texttimes ~10-13), comparative body size (b~=~0.020, P~=~2.539~\texttimes ~10-6) and comparative height size (b~=~-0.020, P~=~5.892~\texttimes ~10-11) at the age of ten years in total samples. In females, birth weight (b~=~-0.040, P~=~2.870~\texttimes ~10-24) and comparative height size (b~=~-0.040, P~=~2.034~\texttimes ~10-20) were statistically associated with adult heel BMD. In males, comparative body size appeared to be associated with adult heel BMD (b~=~0.030, P~=~1.590~\texttimes ~10-7). Conclusion Our study results support the predictive effects of birth weight and growth parameters at the age of ten years on adult heel BMD. We also observed sex-specific association between adult heel BMD and growth parameters at the age of ten years.},
