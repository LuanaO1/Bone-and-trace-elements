  abstract = {This systematic review explored associations between smoking and health outcomes involving the musculoskeletal system. AMSTAR criteria were followed. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct returned 243 articles meeting inclusion criteria. A majority of studies found smoking has negative effects on the musculoskeletal system. In research on bones, smoking was associated with lower BMD, increased fracture risk, periodontitis, alveolar bone loss, and dental implant failure. In research on joints, smoking was associated with increased joint disease activity, poor functional outcomes, and poor therapeutic response. There was also evidence of adverse effects on muscles, tendons, cartilage, and ligaments. There were few studies on the musculoskeletal health outcomes of secondhand smoke, smoking cessation, or other modes of smoking, such as waterpipes or electronic cigarettes. This review found evidence that suggests tobacco smoking has negative effects on the health outcomes of the musculoskeletal system. There is a need for further research to understand mechanisms of action for the effects of smoking on the musculoskeletal system and to increase awareness of healthcare providers and community members of the adverse effects of smoking on the musculoskeletal system.},

  abstract = {Background Life style and physical activity play a pivotal role in prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. The mechanism for better bone metabolism and improvement of physical disorders is not clear yet. Trace minerals such as Ca, Mn, Cu, and Zn are essential precursors for most vital biological process, especially those of bone health. Objective The main target of this study was evaluating the effective role of supervised aerobic exercise for 1 hour/day, 3 days/week for 12 weeks in the functions of trace elements in bone health through measuring bone mineral density (BMD), osteoporosis (T-score), bone markers, and trace element concentrations in healthy subjects aged 30\textendash 60 years with age average of 41.2{$\pm$}4.9. Methods A total of 100 healthy subjects (47 males, 53 females; age range 30\textendash 60 years) were recruited for this study. Based on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan analysis, the participants were classified into three groups: normal (n=30), osteopenic (n=40), and osteoporotic (n=30). Following, 12 weeks of moderate aerobic exercise, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), BMD, T-score, and trace elements such as Ca, Mn, Cu, and Zn were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Results Significant improvement in serum BAP level, T-score, and BMD were observed in all participants following 12 weeks of moderate exercise. Participants with osteopenia and osteoporosis showed significant increase in serum Ca and Mn, along with decrease in serum Cu and Zn levels following 12 weeks of aerobic training. In control group, the improvements in serum trace elements and body mass index were significantly linked with the enhancement in the levels of BAP, BMD hip, and BMD spine. These results supported the preventive effects of moderate exercise in healthy subjects against osteoporosis. In both sexes, the changes in serum trace elements significantly correlated (P{$<$}0.05) with the improvement in BAP, BMD hip, BMD spine, and body mass index in all groups. Conclusion The observed changes in the levels of Ca, Mn, Cu, and Zn were shown to be positively correlated with improved bone mass density among control and osteoporosis subjects of both sexes. These results demonstrate that aerobic exercise of moderate intensity might protect bone and cartilage by regulation of body trace elements which are involved in the biosynthesis of bone matrix structures and inhibition of bone resorption process via a proposed anti-free radical mechanism.},

  abstract = {Objective There is scant research examining the prevalence of thinness in early childhood, despite its potential negative consequences for health and development across the life course. The objective of this study was to assess bone status through measurement of bone mineral density and biochemical bone turnover markers, with special attention paid to carboxylated (c-OC) as well as undercarboxylated (uc-OC) forms of osteocalcin, in the groups of thin and normal-weight children. Design The study included 80 healthy prepubertal children (median age 7.0 years), who were divided (according to Cole's international cutoffs) into 2 subgroups: thin children (n = 40, body mass index [BMI] = 13.5 kg/m2) and normal-weight children (n = 40, BMI = 16.1 kg/m2). Bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) were assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry method. Serum concentrations of C-terminal telopeptide of collagen type I (CTX), total osteocalcin (OC), and c-OC, and uc-OC forms of osteocalcin were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results In thin children, we observed higher levels of bone resorption marker CTX compared with normal-weight peers. Total osteocalcin concentrations were comparable in both groups of children; however, in thin children we observed higher median values of uc-OC (34.40 vs. 29.30 ng/mL, P {$<$} 0.05) and similar c-OC levels (25.65 vs. 28.80 ng/mL). The ratio of c-OC to uc-OC was significantly lower (P {$<$} 0.05) in thin than in normal-weight children. Total BMD and BMC were significantly decreased (P {$<$} 0.0001) in thin children compared with normal-weight peers (0.724 {$\pm$} 0.092 vs. 0.815 {$\pm$} 0.060 g/cm2 and 602.7 {$\pm$} 159.2 vs. 818.2 {$\pm$} 220.1 g, respectively). Conclusion Increased concentrations of CTX and uc-OC might lead to disturbances in bone turnover and a decrease in bone mineral density in thin children.},

  abstract = {Background Osteoporosis is a skeletal metabolic disorder characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD) and reduced bone strength leading to higher bone fractures risk. The present study attempted to investigate the effects of concurrent training (aerobic-resistance) and milk consumption on some markers of BMD in women with osteoporosis. Methods For this purpose, forty women diagnosed with osteoporosis within an age range of 30-45\,years were divided into four groups of ten including concurrent training-milk, concurrent training, milk consumption and control group. The concurrent exercises were performed in ten weeks with three sessions in each week including aerobic training (running at 55\textendash 75\% of maximum heart rate) and resistance training (4 move in a circle performed two times with 10 repetition maximum (RM)). Milk consumption was two times of 250\,ml per day in ten weeks. Before and after treatment, BMDs in the hip and lumbar spine area were estimated with Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) device and 5\,cc blood was taken from a vein in the arm to determine the blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OH-D) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Results Based on the results, blood levels 25OH-D and ALP significantly increased in concurrent training-milk, concurrent training and milk group with higher increase in concurrent training-milk group (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). Furthermore, the right and left hip BMD in concurrent training-milk and concurrent training groups increased significantly with higher increase in concurrent training-milk group (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). Also, lumbar spine BMD increased significantly in concurrent training-milk and concurrent training (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). Conclusions It seems that combination of concurrent training and milk consumption has more efficient impacts on the BMD of young women diagnosed with osteoporosis compared to the milk or concurrent training groups alone. This treatment can be used as an effective way to improve BMD in young women with diagnosed osteoporosis.},

Procedure We conducted a prospective, multicenter cohort study to identify changes in bone health markers during the first 100 days after allogeneic HCT in 26 children. Bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC), and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations were measured at baseline, 30 days, and 100 days after HCT. Results Mean (SD) BMD and BMC Z-scores (-0.48 {$\pm$} 1.09 and -0.98 {$\pm$} 1.26, respectively) were normal at baseline. Repeated-measures analysis revealed significant declines in BMD and BMC Z-scores over the 100 day study period, when adjusted for age, sex, Tanner stage, lean mass, fat mass, resting energy expenditure, total energy intake, insulin sensitivity, serum phosphorus, and inpatient steroid intake. Adjusted mean (SE) 25OHD concentrations declined from 29.2 (3.1) ng/ml at baseline, to 17.7 (1.8) ng/ml at 100 days after HCT. Vitamin D deficiency (25OHD {$<$}20 ng/ml) was present in 50\% of patients 100 days after HCT.

  abstract = {The heavy metal lead (Pb) has a deleterious effect on skeletal health. Because bone mass is maintained through a balance of bone formation and resorption, it is important to understand the effect of Pb levels on osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity. Pb exposure is associated with low bone mass in animal models and human populations; however, the correlation between Pb dosing and corresponding bone mass has been poorly explored. Thus, mice were exposed to increasing Pb and at higher levels (500\,ppm), there was unexpectedly an increase in femur-tibial bone mass by 3 months of age. This is contrary to several studies alluded to earlier. Increased bone volume (BV) was accompanied by a significant increase in cortical thickness of the femur and trabecular bone that extended beyond the epiphyseal area into the marrow cavity. Subsequent evaluations revealed an increase in osteoclast numbers with high Pb exposure, but a deficiency in osteoclastic activity. These findings were substantiated by observed increases in levels of the resorption-altering hormones calcitonin and estrogen. In addition we found that pro-osteoclastic nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-{$\kappa$}B) pathway activity was dose dependently elevated with Pb, both in~vivo and in~vitro. However, the ability of osteoclasts to resorb bone was depressed in the presence of Pb in media and within test bone wafers. These findings indicate that exposure to high Pb levels disrupts early life bone accrual that may involve a disruption of osteoclast activity. This study accentuates the dose dependent variation in Pb exposure and consequent effects on skeletal health.},

The dental and skeletal effects of high fluoride intake have already been studied in the literature, but little is known about the effects of high fluoride intake on edentulous mandibles. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of high fluoride intake on mandibular bone mineral density (BMD) measured by the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) technique in edentulous individuals with systemic fluorosis. Methods 32 people who were living in an endemic fluorosis area since birth and 31 people who were living in a non-endemic fluorosis area since birth (control group) participated in this study. Systemic fluorosis was diagnosed in the patients using the sialic acid (NANA)/glycosaminoglycan (GAG) ratio. The BMDs of the mandibles were determined by the DXA technique. Results The serum NANA/GAG ratios in the fluorosis group were significantly lower than those in the control group (p {$<$} 0.001). There was also a statistically significant difference in mandibular BMD measurements (p {$<$} 0.05) between the systemic fluorosis and control groups, as measured by the DXA technique. Mandibular body BMD measurements were higher in the fluorosis group (1.25 {$\pm$} 0.24 g cm-2) than in the control group (1.01 {$\pm$} 0.31 g cm-2). Conclusions The results of the study showed that fluoride intake higher than the optimum level causes increased mandibular BMD in edentulous individuals. Further dose-related studies are needed to determine the effects of high fluoride intake on bony structures of the stomatognathic system.},

Recently, great progress has been made in this direction, and the relevant pathophysiological mechanisms have been better established. While the spectrum of these diseases is wide, and the mechanisms of the onset of malnutrition are numerous and interrelated, clinical and nutritional manifestations are common. The main consequences include an impaired dietary intake, altered macro and micronutrient metabolism, energy metabolism disturbances, an increase in energy expenditure, nutrient malabsorption, sarcopenia, and osteopathy. In this review, we summarize the factors contributing to malnutrition, and the effects on nutritional status and clinical outcomes of liver and pancreatic diseases.

Studies were classified as ``non-industry-authored'' when all authors had academic or governmental affiliations, or as ``industry-authored'' when any of the authors had industry affiliations. Abstracts were analyzed using a part-of-speech tagger to identify adjectives. To reduce the risk of false positives, the analysis was restricted to adjectives considered relevant to ``coloring'' (influencing interpretation) of trial results. Differences between groups were determined using exact tests, stratifying by journal. Results A total of 306,007 publications met the inclusion criteria. We were able to classify 16,789 abstracts; 9,085 were industry-authored research, and 7,704 were non-industry-authored research. We found a differential use of adjectives between industry-authored and non-industry-authored reports. Adjectives such as ``well tolerated'' and ``meaningful'' were more commonly used in the title or conclusion of the abstract by industry authors, while adjectives such as ``feasible'' were more commonly used by non-industry authors.

These elements can accumulate in bone and impact bone metabolism. In this study, we investigated the relationship between age and the concentrations of these elements in human bone and blood. Methods Bone and blood samples were obtained from both older and younger patients. The concentrations of the elements under investigation were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and the specific concentrations in the bone and blood were then calculated. Results The results showed that with increasing age, the concentrations of chromium, cobalt, and thallium in bone decreased significantly, while the concentration of cadmium in bone markedly increased. However, there was no clear correlation between age and the concentrations of these heavy metals in blood. Notably, there was a close correlation between the concentration of cobalt in bone and the presence of osteopenia. Conclusions Senescence of the human body is accompanied by the shifting of cobalt, chromium, and thallium from the bone to the outer- bone. However, the concentration of cadmium in bone increases with age. These changes are very likely to be related to the equilibrium of bone metabolism in senescent individuals. In addition, only cobalt was shown to be significantly related to osteopenia.},

  abstract = {Aims Despite the interest in the association of gut microbiota with bone health, limited population-based studies of gut microbiota and bone mineral density (BMD) have been made. Our aim is to explore the possible association between gut microbiota and BMD. Methods A total of 3,321 independent loci of gut microbiota were used to calculate the individual polygenic risk score (PRS) for 114 gut microbiota-related traits. The individual genotype data were obtained from UK Biobank cohort. Linear regressions were then conducted to evaluate the possible association of gut microbiota with L1-L4 BMD (n = 4,070), total BMD (n = 4,056), and femur total BMD (n = 4,054), respectively. PLINK 2.0 was used to detect the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) \texttimes{} gut microbiota interaction effect on the risks of L1-L4 BMD, total BMD, and femur total BMD, respectively. Results We detected five, three, and seven candidate gut microbiota-related traits for L1-L4 BMD, total BMD, and femur BMD, respectively, such as genus Dialister (p = 0.004) for L1-L4 BMD, and genus Eisenbergiella (p = 0.046) for total BMD. We also detected two common gut microbiota-related traits shared by L1-L4 BMD, total BMD, and femur total BMD, including genus Escherichia Shigella and genus Lactococcus. Interaction analysis of BMD detected several genes that interacted with gut microbiota, such as phospholipase D1 (PLD1) and endomucin (EMCN) interacting with genus Dialister in total BMD, and COL12A1 and Discs Large MAGUK Scaffold Protein 2 (DLG2) interacting with genus Lactococcus in femur BMD. Conclusion Our results suggest associations between gut microbiota and BMD, which will be helpful to further explore the regulation mechanism and intervention gut microbiota of BMD., Cite this article: Bone Joint Res~2021;10(11):734\textendash 741.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between cadmium exposure and osteoporosis by considering the effect of obesity in aged males using a representative sample of the Korean population. Using the fourth and fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data, 1089 males over 50 years of age were analyzed. The blood cadmium concentration was measured. The bone mineral density in the total hip, femur neck, and lumbar spine was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. T-scores to determine the presence of osteoporosis were calculated using a Korean reference. Subjects were stratified into two groups according to obesity status (body mass index {$<$}25 kg/m2 and {$\geq$}25 kg/m2). In comparison with obese subjects with blood cadmium {$<$}1.00 {$\mu$}g/L, those with blood cadmium {$>$}1.50 {$\mu$}g/L had odds ratios of 4.57 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.49\textendash 14.01) and 5.71 (95\% CI 1.99\textendash 16.38) at the femur neck and any site, respectively, after adjusting for potential confounders such as age, serum creatinine, vitamin D deficiency, smoking, alcohol drinking, and physical activity level. However, this association was not significant in non-obese males. In conclusion, the effect of cadmium on osteoporosis was different by obesity status in aged males.},

Previously, we reported that saponin from the roots of Platycodi radix-derived saponin inhibited toxicant-induced liver diseases. Nevertheless, the inhibitory effect of platyconic acid A (PA), the active component of Platycodi radix-derived saponin, on the anti-fibrotic activity involving the SMAD pathway remains unclear. We investigated the inhibitory effects of PA on TGF-{$\beta$}1-induced activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). PA inhibited TGF-{$\beta$}1-enhanced cell proliferation, as well as expression of {$\alpha$}-SMA and collagen I{$\alpha$}1 in HSC-T6 cells. PA suppressed TGF-{$\beta$}1-induced smad2/3 phosphorylation and smad binding elements 4 (SBE4) luciferase activity. Reversely, PA restored TGF-{$\beta$}1-reduced expression of smad7 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR){$\gamma$}. PA also repressed TGF-{$\beta$}1-induced phosphorylation of Akt and MAPKs. In summary, the results suggest that the inhibitory effect of PA on HSCs occurs through the blocking of SMAD-dependent and SMAD-independent pathways, leading to the suppression of {$\alpha$}-SMA and collagen I{$\alpha$}1 expression.},

  abstract = {Compromised zinc status and chronic inflammation are independent factors that can contribute to bone loss. However, zinc's role in regulating lymphoid and myeloid cell populations, combined with the interplay between the immune and skeletal systems raises the question as to the extent to which a low-grade inflammatory challenge in the context of marginal zinc deficiency would exacerbate bone loss. To address this question, young adult C57BL/6 male mice (n=32) were used in a 2\texttimes 2 factorial design with dietary zinc (adequate or 35 ppm vs inadequate or -Zn =5 ppm) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0 or 0.1 mg/kg body weight). Mice were fed their respective diets for 10 weeks. On the 6th week, mice had a slow release pellet implanted to induce a low-grade inflammation for the final 4 weeks of the study. -Zn induced a decrease in total white cell counts and peripheral lymphocytes, whereas LPS increased blood monocytes. LPS significantly reduced spine bone mineral density and trabecular bone volume and number of the vertebral body compared with both zinc adequate and inadequate without LPS groups. Likewise, the most pronounced effects on bone strength occurred with LPS, however, -Zn also had negative effects on the bone von Mises stresses. LPS induced an increase in TNF-{$\alpha$} and this response was further increased with -Zn. Although the marginal zinc deficiency altered immune function, bone loss was not exacerbated with low-grade chronic inflammation in marginally zinc-deficient young adult mice. These findings demonstrate that in young adult animals an immune challenge modestly increases the inflammatory response and worsens bone biomechanics in the context of a marginal zinc deficiency, but not to the extent that more severe adverse outcomes are observed on bone structural parameters.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have established that dysregulation of the human immune system and the reactivation of latent herpesviruses persists for the duration of a 6-month orbital spaceflight. It appears certain aspects of adaptive immunity are dysregulated during flight, yet some aspects of innate immunity are heightened. Interaction between adaptive and innate immunity also seems to be altered. Some crews experience persistent hypersensitivity reactions during flight. This phenomenon may, in synergy with extended duration and galactic radiation exposure, increase specific crew clinical risks during deep space exploration missions. The clinical challenge is based upon both the frequency of these phenomena in multiple crewmembers during low earth orbit missions and the inability to predict which specific individual crewmembers will experience these changes. Thus, a general countermeasure approach that offers the broadest possible coverage is needed. The vehicles, architecture, and mission profiles to enable such voyages are now under development. These include deployment and use of a cis-Lunar station (mid 2020s) with possible Moon surface operations, to be followed by multiple Mars flyby missions, and eventual human Mars surface exploration. Current ISS studies will continue to characterize physiological dysregulation associated with prolonged orbital spaceflight. However, sufficient information exists to begin consideration of both the need for, and nature of, specific immune countermeasures to ensure astronaut health. This article will review relevant in-place operational countermeasures onboard ISS and discuss a myriad of potential immune countermeasures for exploration missions. Discussion points include nutritional supplementation and functional foods, exercise and immunity, pharmacological options, the relationship between bone and immune countermeasures, and vaccination to mitigate herpes (and possibly other) virus risks. As the immune system has sentinel connectivity within every other physiological system, translational effects must be considered for all potential immune countermeasures. Finally, we shall discuss immune countermeasures in the context of their individualized implementation or precision medicine, based on crewmember specific immunological biases.},

The aim of this study was to examine differences in habitual physical activity (PA), dietary intake patterns, and musculoskeletal performance among community-dwelling elderly men with low and elevated systemic inflammation. Nonsarcopenic older men free of chronic diseases were grouped as `low' (LSI: n = 17; 68.2 {$\pm$} 2.6 years; hs-CRP: {$<$}1 mg/L) or `elevated' (ESI: n = 17; 68.7 {$\pm$} 3.0 years; hs-CRP: {$>$}1 mg/L) systemic inflammation according to their serum levels of high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP). All participants were assessed for body composition via Dual Emission X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA), physical performance using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and handgrip strength, daily PA using accelerometry, and daily macro- and micronutrient intake. ESI was characterized by a 2-fold greater hs-CRP value than LSI (p {$<$} 0.01). The two groups were comparable in terms of body composition, but LSI displayed higher physical performance (p {$<$} 0.05), daily PA (step count/day and time at moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) were greater by 30\% and 42\%, respectively, p {$<$} 0.05), and daily intake of the antioxidant vitamins A (6590.7 vs. 4701.8 IU/day, p {$<$} 0.05), C (120.0 vs. 77.3 mg/day, p {$<$} 0.05), and E (10.0 vs. 7.5 mg/day, p {$<$} 0.05) compared to ESI. Moreover, daily intake of vitamin A was inversely correlated with levels of hs-CRP (r = -0.39, p = 0.035). These results provide evidence that elderly men characterized by low levels of systemic inflammation are more physically active, spend more time in MVPA, and receive higher amounts of antioxidant vitamins compared to those with increased systemic inflammation.},

Chronically patients have an increased daily caloric requirement (mean +/- SE, 56 +/- 1 kcal/kg), not wholly explained by moderate steatorrhea (fecal fat excretion, 16\% +/- 2\% of unrestricted fat intake). Despite persistent malabsorption, deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamin, magnesium, and trace element serum levels can be prevented in most patients. Pancreatogenic diabetes is characterized by (1) absence of the major glucoregulatory hormones insulin and glucagon, (2) instability, and (3) frequent hypoglycemia, with the latter parameters improving with rigorous home glucose monitoring. No patient has developed clinically overt diabetic micro- or macrovascular disease. Performance status in long-term survivors has been reasonable. However adverse chronic sequelae of the operation occur and include an unusual frequency of liver disease, characterized by accelerated fatty infiltration, and osteopenia, with an 18\% reduction in radial bone mineral content noted in pancreatectomized patients studied more than 5 years after surgery.},

Since copper is an essential micronutrient for human development, a cross-sectional study was carried out to investigate the serum copper levels, serum copper/zinc (Cu/Zn) ratios, and their relationship with nutritional indicators in a group of CF patients. Anthropometric, biochemical, and dietary measurements, an abdominal ultrasound, and respiratory and pancreatic tests were conducted. Seventeen CF patients were studied (10 females, 59\%), 76.5\% of whom were {$\increment$}F580. Their mean serum copper (113 {$\pm$} 23 {$\mu$}g/dL) was normal, and there was only one teenager with hypocupremia (6\%) and two children with hypercupremia (18\%). A significant association between serum copper and zinc levels was discovered. The Cu/Zn ratio was higher than 1.00 for 94\% of patients, which is an indicator of an inflammation status. There was no significant correlation between the serum copper concentrations and respiratory and pancreatic function, respiratory colonization, and the results of the abdominal ultrasound. Linear regression analysis showed that serum copper had a positive association with both the Z-score body mass index (BMI) and mean bone conduction speed (BCS). Therefore, since 94\% of CF patients had a Cu/Zn ratio {$>$} 1.00, this factor must alert us to consider the risk of zinc deficiency and high inflammatory response. The measurement of serum zinc alone does not show one's zinc status. However, the Cu/Zn ratio may be an indicator of zinc deficiency and the inflammatory status of CF patients.},

  abstract = {Background: Patients with thalassemia major (Thal) frequently have low plasma zinc, which has been associated with low bone mass., Objective: The objective was to determine the effect of zinc supplementation on bone mass in patients with Thal., Design: Forty-two subjects (21 females aged 10\textendash 30 y) with Thal and low bone mass were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg Zn/d or placebo. Bone mineral content (BMC) and areal bone mineral density (aBMD) were assessed by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and fasting blood was collected for the measurement of plasma zinc at 0, 12, and 18 mo., Results: Thirty-two subjects, 81\% of whom were transfusion dependent, completed the study (mean {$\pm$} SD: 17.1 {$\pm$} 5.2 y). Plasma zinc was {$\leq$}70 {$\mu$}g/dL in 11 subjects at baseline and increased significantly with zinc supplementation (P = 0.014). Use of intention-to-treat analysis and linear models for longitudinal data, adjusted for baseline and pubertal stage, showed that the zinc group had significantly greater increases in whole-body BMC (adjusted mean {$\pm$} SE: 63 {$\pm$} 15 g; P = 0.02), and aBMD (0.023 {$\pm$} 0.006 g/cm2; P = 0.04) than did the placebo group after 18 mo. Furthermore, adjusted spine and hip aBMD z scores each decreased by 0.3 SDs (both P = 0.04) in the placebo compared with the zinc group over the 18-mo study., Conclusions: In young patients with Thal, zinc supplementation resulted in greater gains in total-body bone mass than did placebo. Zinc was well tolerated and is worthy of investigation in larger trials in Thal patients across a range of ages and disease severity. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00459732.},

Individuals with compromised bone strength were educated about skeletal health issues and provided with therapeutic options for potential amelioration of their bone health. Patients who declined pharmacotherapy or who previously experienced failure of drug treatment were offered other options including supplemental micronutrients identified in the medical literature as sometimes having a positive impact on bone mineral density (BMD). After 12 months of consecutive supplemental micronutrient therapy with a combination that included vitamin D3, vitamin K2, strontium, magnesium and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), repeat bone densitometry was performed. The results were analyzed in a group of compliant patients and demonstrate improved BMD in patients classified with normal, osteopenic and osteoporotic bone density. According to the results, this combined micronutrient supplementation regimen appears to be at least as effective as bisphosphonates or strontium ranelate in raising BMD levels in hip, spine, and femoral neck sites. No fractures occurred in the group taking the micronutrient protocol. This micronutrient regimen also appears to show efficacy in individuals where bisphosphonate therapy was previously unsuccessful in maintaining or raising BMD. Prospective clinical trials are required to confirm efficacy.},

  abstract = {Moderate/severe obesity is on the rise in the United States. Weight management includes bariatric surgery, which is effective and can alleviate morbidity and mortality from obesity-associated diseases. However, many individuals are dealing with nutritional complications. Risk factors include: 1) preoperative malnutrition (e.g., vitamin D, iron); 2) decreased food intake (due to reduced hunger and increased satiety, food intolerances, frequent vomiting); 3) inadequate nutrient supplementation (due to poor compliance with multivitamin/multimineral regimen, insufficient amounts of vitamins and/or minerals in supplements); 4) nutrient malabsorption; and 5) inadequate nutritional support (due to lack of follow-up, insufficient monitoring, difficulty in recognizing symptoms of deficiency). For some nutrients (e.g., protein, vitamin B-12, vitamin D), malnutrition issues are reasonably addressed through patient education, routine monitoring, and effective treatment strategies. However, there is little attention paid to other nutrients (e.g., zinc, copper), which if left untreated may have devastating consequences (e.g., hair loss, poor immunity, anemia, defects in neuro-muscular function). This review focuses on malnutrition in essential minerals, including calcium (and vitamin D), iron, zinc, and copper, which commonly occur following popular bariatric procedures. There will be emphasis on the complexities, including confounding factors, related to screening, recognition of symptoms, and, when available, current recommendations for treatment. There is an exceptionally high risk of malnutrition in adolescents and pregnant women and their fetuses, who may be vulnerable to problems in growth and development. More research is required to inform evidence-based recommendations for improving nutritional status following bariatric surgery and optimizing weight loss, metabolic, and nutritional outcomes.},

We also investigated the effect of artificial gravity on copper and zinc homeostasis., Methods: Zinc and copper balances were studied in 15 men [mean {$\pm$} SD age: 29 {$\pm$} 3 y; body mass index (in kg/m2): 26.4 {$\pm$} 2.2] before, during, and after 21 d of head-down tilt BR, during which 8 of the participants were subjected to artificial gravity (AG) by centrifugation for 1 h/d. Control subjects were transferred onto the centrifuge but were not exposed to centrifugation. The study was conducted in a metabolic ward; all urine and feces were collected. Data were analyzed by 2-factor repeated-measures ANOVA., Results: Urinary zinc excretion values for control and AG groups were 33\% and 14\%, respectively, higher during BR than before BR, and fecal zinc excretion values for control and AG groups were 36\% and 19\%, respectively, higher during BR, resulting in 67\% and 82\% lower net zinc balances for controls and AG, respectively (both P {$<$} 0.01), despite lower nutrient intake during BR. Fecal copper values for control and AG groups were 40\% and 33\%, respectively, higher during BR than before BR (P {$<$} 0.01 for both). Urinary copper did not change during BR, but a 19\% increase was observed after BR compared with before BR in the AG group (P {$<$} 0.05)., Conclusions: The increased fecal excretion of copper and zinc by men during BR suggests that their absorption of these minerals from the diet was reduced, secondary to the release of minerals from bone and muscle. These findings highlight the importance of determining dietary requirements for astronauts on space missions and ensuring provision and intake of all nutrients.},

  abstract = {Osteoporosis is a prevalent and debilitating condition with no signs of subsiding. Rising numbers of people consuming nutrient-poor diets coupled with ageing populations and sedentary lifestyles appear to be the main drivers behind this.                                         While the nutrients calcium and vitamin D have received most attention, there is growing evidence that wholefoods and other micronutrients have roles to play in primary and potentially secondary osteoporosis prevention.                                         Until recently, calcium and vitamin D were regarded as the main nutrients essential to bone health but now there are emerging roles for iron, copper and selenium, among others.                                         Fruit and vegetables are still not being eaten in adequate amounts and yet contain micronutrients and phytochemicals useful for bone remodelling (bone formation and resorption) and are essential for reducing inflammation and oxidative stress.                                         There is emerging evidence that dried fruits, such as prunes, provide significant amounts of vitamin K, manganese, boron, copper and potassium which could help to support bone health.                                         Just 50 g of prunes daily have been found to reduce bone resorption after six months when eaten by osteopaenic, postmenopausal women.                                         Dairy foods have an important role in bone health. Carbonated drinks should not replace milk in the diet.                                         A balanced diet containing food groups and nutrients needed for bone health across the whole lifecycle may help to prevent osteoporosis.

Historical examples demonstrate that a failure to supply adequate nutrition to armies inevitably leads to disaster; however, innovative measures to overcome difficulties in feeding reap benefits, and save lives. In barracks, UK Armed Forces are currently fed according to the relatively new Pay As You Dine policy, which has attracted criticism from some quarters. The recently introduced Multi-Climate Ration has been developed specifically to deal with issues arising from Iraq and the current conflict in Afghanistan. Severely wounded military personnel are likely to lose a significant amount of their muscle mass, in spite of the best medical care. Nutritional support is unable to prevent this, but can ameliorate the effects of the catabolic process. Measuring and quantifying nutritional status during critical illness is difficult. A consensus is beginning to emerge from studies investigating the effects of nutritional interventions on how, what and when to feed patients with critical illness. The Ministry of Defence is currently undertaking research to address specific concerns related to nutrition as well as seeking to promote healthy eating in military personnel.},

We previously reported that parabens promoted adipocyte differentiation in vitro and increased adiposity but suppressed serum marker of bone formation in vivo. Here, we investigated the effects of parabens (methylparaben and butylparaben) on modulating cell fate of multipotent stem cell line C3H10T1/2. Both parabens modulated adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells in vitro. Butylparaben markedly promoted adipogenic differentiation, but suppressed osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation whereas methylparaben showed similar but less pronounced effects. Moreover, butylparaben, but not methylparaben, was shown to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) {$\gamma$} whereas neither of the paraben was shown to activate glucocorticoid receptor (GR) responsive reporter in C3H10T1/2 cells. The adipogenic effects of butylparaben were significantly attenuated by PPAR{$\gamma$} knockdown, but not by GR knockdown. In contrast, paraben's effects on osteoblast differentiation were affected by both knockdowns. Collectively, the results demonstrate opposing effects of parabens on adipogenic and osteoblastogenic/chondrogenic differentiation of multipotent stem cells. In light of the recent findings that parabens are detected in human placenta and milk, our studies provide rationales to study paraben exposure during early development of life in the future.},

  abstract = {Purpose This study examined the role of trace elements in osteoporosis by comparing the trace-element concentrations in bone and the radiographic bone density and bone mineral density (BMD) of patients with osteoporotic femur fractures and osteoarthritis. Patients and methods The study enrolled 30 patients operated on for proximal femoral fractures after falls, and another 30 patients undergoing hip arthroplasty at the same center for hip osteoarthritis. Bone samples were obtained during the surgical procedures. The density of the bone samples was assessed using computed tomography and the Hounsfield scale. The levels of Ca(II), Mg(II), and other trace elements in the bone samples were determined using flame atomic absorption spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. In addition, BMD, Z-scores, and T-scores were measured in the unaffected hips of all patients using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results Magnesium (1,908{$\pm$}507 versus 2,540{$\pm$}435, P{$<$}0.05), calcium (10.4{$\pm$}3.5 versus 13.9{$\pm$}3.7, P{$<$}0.05), and zinc (2,342{$\pm$}1,252 versus 3,145{$\pm$}1,604, P{$<$}0.05) {$\mu$}g g-1, levels were significantly lower in the bone samples in the fracture group. The groups did not differ in the other biochemical parameters. All dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry findings were significantly worse in the fracture group than in the osteoarthritis group. However, the groups did not differ in femoral neck density assessed radiologically using the Hounsfield scale. The following parameters were negatively correlated with age: magnesium, r=-0.436, P{$<$}0.001; calcium, r=-0.331, P=0.01; T-score, r=-0.381, P=0.003; Z-score, r=-0.267, P=0.043; and BMD, r=-0.365, P=0.004. Conclusion Ca(II), Mg(II), and Zn(II) appear to play important roles in bone breakdown/synthesis. Further studies of the roles of trace elements in the etiology and treatment of osteoporosis are warranted. We found decreased bone levels of Ca, Mg, and Zn in patients with osteoporotic fractures compared to subjects with osteoarthritis.},

  abstract = {Objective: Most of phenylketonuria (PKU) develops bone turnover impairment and low bone mineral density (BMD). Measurements of BMD reflect only bone mineral status but not the dynamics of bone turnover. Bone~markers~are a noninvasive tool useful for the assessment of bone formation and bone resorption processes. Our study was to assess the levels of bone markers in PKU in order to select a screen marker and detect the most specific marker which can be combined with BMD for appropriate follow up.,  Methods: Thirty three classic PKU patients were studied. BMD and bone mineral content (BMC) were measured. Total alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OC) and carboxy-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (CICP), osteoprotegerin (OPG), receptor activator of nuclear factor {$\kappa\beta$} ligand (RANKL) and Deoxypyridinoline (DPD) were measured.,  Findings : Nineteen (57.6\%) male and fourteen (42.4 \%) female PKU patients were involved in the current study. Their mean age was 8.4{$\pm$}4.6 yrs and the age range 3-19 yrs. The control group consisted of twenty two (52.4\%) males and twenty (47.6\%) females. Their mean age was 8.5{$\pm$}3.3 yrs and th age range 2-17 yrs. Using the Z score values, there was a significant decrease of total BMC (TBMC-Z), BMD of the femoral neck BMD-FN-Z, BMD of lumbar vertebrae (BMD-L-Z), BMD-FN and DPD while RANKL increased. There was a negative correlation between CICP and TBMC and between CICP and BMD-L in these patients. Also, a negative correlation between ALP and TBMC and between ALP and BMD-L was observed. It was concluded that the ALP provides a good impression of the new bone formation in the PKU patients and it has a highly significant negative correlation with the many parameters of the bone mineral status beside the wide availability of inexpensive and simple methods. So a screening test and/or follow up for the PKU patients using ALP would be available. Once the level of ALP decrease is detected, one can combine it with BMD to explore the bone mineral status and with specific bone markers (OC, RANKL and DBD), to verify the dynamics of bone turnover. ,  Conclusion: This schedule will reduce the risk of exposure of these patients to the risk hazards of DXA and limit its use only to a limited number of the highly suspected cases.},

  abstract = {The severity of osteoporosis in humans manifests in its high incidence and by its complications that diminish quality of life. A societal consequence of osteoporosis is the substantial burden that it inflicts upon patients and their families. Several bone-modifying drugs have been prescribed to patients with osteoporosis. However, evidence for their anti-fracture efficacy remains inconclusive. To the contrary, long-term use of anti-osteoporotic drugs such as bisphosphonates and Denosumab, an RANKL inhibitor, have resulted in adverse events. We now present an alternative and adjuvant approach for treatment of osteoporosis. The data derive from in vivo studies in an ovariectomized rat model and from a randomized double blind, placebo-controlled human clinical study. Both studies involved treatment with Panaceo Micro Activation (PMA)-zeolite-clinoptilolite, a defined cation exchange clinoptilolite, which clearly improved all bone histomorphometric parameters examined from ovariectomized animals, indicative for increased bone formation. Moreover, intervention with PMA-zeolite-clinoptilolite for one year proved safe in humans. Furthermore, patients treated with PMA-zeolite-clinoptilolite showed an increase in bone mineral density, an elevated level of markers indicative of bone formation, a significant reduction in pain, and significantly improved quality of life compared with patients in the control (placebo) group. These encouraging positive effects of PMA-zeolite-clinoptilolite on bone integrity and on osteoporosis warrant further evaluation of treatment with PMA-zeolite-clinoptilolite as a new alternative adjuvant therapy for osteoporosis.},

This guideline for management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults over 16 years of age was developed by Stakeholders representing UK physicians (British Society of Gastroenterology), surgeons (Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland), specialist nurses (Royal College of Nursing), paediatricians (British Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition), dietitians (British Dietetic Association), radiologists (British Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology), general practitioners (Primary Care Society for Gastroenterology) and patients (Crohn's and Colitis UK). A systematic review of 88\,247 publications and a Delphi consensus process involving 81 multidisciplinary clinicians and patients was undertaken to develop 168 evidence- and expert opinion-based recommendations for pharmacological, non-pharmacological and surgical interventions, as well as optimal service delivery in the management of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Comprehensive up-to-date guidance is provided regarding indications for, initiation and monitoring of immunosuppressive therapies, nutrition interventions, pre-, peri- and postoperative management, as well as structure and function of the multidisciplinary team and integration between primary and secondary care. Twenty research priorities to inform future clinical management are presented, alongside objective measurement of priority importance, determined by 2379 electronic survey responses from individuals living with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, including patients, their families and friends.},

Evidence supports the efficacy of high-calcium, high-dairy diets in achieving healthy weight in adults.

Participants had above-the-median body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2)., Design: We enrolled 274 healthy postmenarcheal 13- to 14-y-old overweight girls who had calcium intakes of {$\leq$}600 mg/d in a 12-mo randomized controlled trial.

The assignments were 1) dairy, which included low-fat milk or yogurt servings providing {$\geq$}1200 mg Ca/d or 2) control, which included the usual diet of {$\leq$}600 mg Ca/d., Results: We failed to detect a statistically significant difference between groups in percentage of body fat gain over 12 mo (mean {$\pm$} SEM: dairy 0.40\% {$\pm$} 0.53\% {$>$} control; P {$<$} 0.45). The effect of the intervention did not differ by BMI percentile stratum. There was no difference in weight change between the 2 groups., Conclusion: Our findings that the dairy group gained body fat similar to the control group provide no support for dairy food as a stratagem to decrease body fat or weight gain in overweight adolescent girls. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01066806.},

Among various factors affected bone health, not only dietary calcium and phosphorus intakes, but also the dietary calcium/phosphorus ratio could relate to bone health. Therefore, we evaluated whether dietary calcium and phosphorus intakes, and dietary calcium/phosphorus ratio are associated with bone mass in Korean adults\,{$\geq$}\,20~years of age. Methods The analysis used data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-sectional survey of Korean civilians, conducted from January to December 2010. A total of 4,935 participants (2,309 men and 2,626 women) were analyzed in this study. Dietary calcium and phosphorus intakes of the participants were estimated using 24-h dietary recall. Bone mass densities for the whole body, femoral neck, and lumbar spine were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results Dietary calcium intake and dietary calcium/phosphorus ratio were positively related to bone mass density for femoral neck in men\,{$\geq$}\,50~years of age (p\,=\,0.046 and 0.041, respectively). Dietary calcium intake showed positive associations with bone mass density for whole body in premenopausal women (p\,=\,0.022). Conclusions Increased calcium intake and high dietary calcium/phosphorus ratio might have favorable effects on bone mass in Korean adults. Additional gender- and age-specific studies are needed to further identify the influence of calcium and phosphorus intakes, and the dietary calcium/phosphorus ratio on bone mass.},

  abstract = {Osteoporosis is a common metabolic bone disease. The impact of global blood plasma proteins on the risk of osteoporosis remains elusive now. We performed a large-scale polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis to evaluate the potential effects of blood plasma proteins on the development of osteoporosis in 2286 Caucasians, including 558 males and 1728 females. Bone mineral density (BMD) and bone areas at ulna \& radius, hip, and spine were measured using Hologic 4500W DXA. BMD/bone areas values were adjusted for age, sex, height, and weight as covariates. Genome-wide SNP genotyping of 2286 Caucasian subjects was performed using Affymetrix Human SNP Array 6.0. The 267 blood plasma proteins-associated SNP loci and their genetic effects were obtained from recently published genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a highly multiplexed aptamer-based affinity proteomics platform. The polygenetic risk score (PRS) of study subjects for each blood plasma protein was calculated from the genotypes data of the 2286 Caucasian subjects by PLINK software. Pearson correlation analysis of individual PRS values and BMD/bone area value was performed using R. Additionally, gender-specific analysis also was performed by Pearson correlation analysis. 267 blood plasma proteins were analyzed in this study. For BMD, we observed association signals between 41 proteins and BMD, mainly including whole body total BMD versus Factor H (p value = 9.00 \texttimes{} 10-3), whole body total BMD versus BGH3 (p value = 1.40 \texttimes{} 10-2), spine total BMD versus IGF-I (p value = 2.15 \texttimes{} 10-2), and spine total BMD versus SAP (p value = 3.90 \texttimes{} 10-2). As for bone areas, association evidence was observed between 45 blood plasma proteins and bone areas, such as ferritin versus spine area (p value = 1.90 \texttimes{} 10-2), C4 versus hip area (p value = 1.25 \texttimes{} 10-2), and hemoglobin versus right ulna and radius area (p value = 2.70 \texttimes{} 10-2). Our study results suggest the modest impact of blood plasma proteins on the variations of BMD/bone areas, and identify several candidate blood plasma proteins for osteoporosis.},

  abstract = {Purpose of Review To highlight recent basic, translational, and clinical work demonstrating exercise and diet regulation of marrow adipose tissue (MAT) and bone, and how this informs current understanding of the relationship between marrow adiposity and musculoskeletal health. Recent Findings Marrow adipocytes accumulate in bone in the setting of hypercaloric intake (calorie excess; e.g. diet-induced obesity), but also with hypocaloric intake (calorie restriction; e.g. anorexia), despite the fact that these states affect bone differently. With hypercaloric intake, bone quantity is largely unaffected whereas with hypocaloric intake, bone quantity and quality are greatly diminished. Voluntary running exercise in rodents was found to lower MAT and promote bone in eucaloric and hypercaloric states, while degrading bone in hypocaloric states, suggesting differential modulation of MAT and bone, dependent upon whole body energy status. Energy status alters bone metabolism and bioenergetics via substrate availability or excess, which plays a key role in the response of bone and MAT to mechanical stimuli. Summary Marrow adipose tissue (MAT) is a fat depot with a potential role in \textendash{} as well as responsivity to \textendash{} whole body energy metabolism. Understanding the localized function of this depot in bone cell bioenergetics and substrate storage, principally in the exercised state, will aid to uncover putative therapeutic targets for skeletal fragility.},

  abstract = {Calcium phosphate-based bone substitutes have been widely used for bone repair, augmentation and reconstruction in bone implant surgery. While some of these substitutes have shown excellent biological efficacy, there remains a need to improve the performance of the current calcium phosphate-based bone substitutes. Strontium ions (Sr) can promote new osteogenesis, inhibit osteoclast formation and increase osteoconductivity. However, the therapeutic effect and mechanism of strontium-containing {$\alpha$}-calcium sulfate hemihydrate (Sr-CaS) remains unclear. The present study created bone injuries in rats and treated the injuries with Sr-CaS. Then Cell Counting Kit-8, soft agar colony formation, flow cytometry, Transwell and Alizarin Red staining assays were performed to assess the bone cells for their proliferation, growth, apoptosis, invasion, and osteogenic differentiation abilities. The bone reconstructive states were measured by the microCT method, hematoxylin and eosin staining and Masson staining. Bone-related factors were analyzed by the reverse transcription-quantitative PCR assay; transforming growth factor (TGF)-{$\beta$}, mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (Smad)2/3 and {$\beta$}-catenin expression was measured by western blot analysis and osteocalcin (OCN) expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Sr-CaS did not significantly affect the proliferation and apoptosis of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs), but did accelerate the migration and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro. Sr-CaS promoted bone repair and significantly increased the values for bone mineral density, bone volume fraction, and trabecular thickness, but decreased trabecular spacing in vivo in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, Sr-CaS dramatically upregulated the expression levels of genes associated with osteogenic differentiation (Runt-related transcription factor 2, Osterix, ALP, OCN and bone sialoprotein) both in vitro and in vivo. Sr-CaS also increased Smad2/3, TGF-{$\beta$} and phosphorylated-{$\beta$}-catenin protein expression in vitro and in vivo. These results indicated that materials that contain 5 or 10\% Sr can improve bone defects by regulating the TGF-{$\beta$}/Smad signaling pathway.},

To examine bone mineral density (BMD) in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its relationship to brain structure and cognition we evaluated 71 patients with early stage AD (Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 0.5 and 1) and 69 non-demented elderly control participants (CDR 0). Measures included whole body BMD by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and normalized whole brain volumes computed from structural MRI scans. Cognition was assessed with a standard neuropsychological test battery. Mean BMD was lower in the early AD group (1.11 {$\pm$} 0.13) compared to the non-demented control group (1.16 {$\pm$} 0.12, p=0.02), independent of age, sex, habitual physical activity, smoking, depression, estrogen replacement, and apolipoprotein E4 carrier status. In the early AD group, BMD was related to whole brain volume (b=0.18, p=0.03). BMD was also associated with cognitive performance, primarily in tests of memory (logical memory [b=0.15, p=0.04], delayed logical memory [b=0.16, p=0.02], and the selective reminding task, free recall [b=0.18, p=0.009]). Bone mineral density is reduced in the earliest clinical stages of AD and associated with brain atrophy and memory decline, suggesting that central mechanisms may contribute to bone loss in early Alzheimer's disease.},

Tridimensional bone imaging techniques such as high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) allow the assessment of both compartmental volumetric densities and microarchitecture. Our aim was to evaluate these parameters in children and teenagers receiving long-term PN. This cross-sectional, case\textendash control study included children older than 9~years undergoing PN for at least 2~years. They were age-, gender- and puberty-matched with healthy controls (1:2). Evaluation included biological assessment of bone metabolism (serum calcium, phosphate, and albumin; urinary calcium and creatinine; 25-OH vitamin D, osteocalcin and PTH), dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and HR-pQCT at the ultradistal tibia and radius. Results are presented as median [range]. Eleven patients (3 girls) with a median age of 16 [9\textendash 19] years were included. Bone parameters assessed by HR-pQCT at the ultradistal radius and tibia were similar in patients and controls. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were higher (14 [7\textendash 115] vs 16 [12\textendash 27]) and osteocalcin levels were lower (44 [15\textendash 65] vs 65 [38\textendash 142]) in patients than in controls, although within the normal range. Conclusions: there were no differences for compartmental bone densities and microarchitecture in patients undergoing chronic PN. Further longitudinal studies are required to confirm these quite reassuring preliminary results.},

  abstract = {Introduction Bone mass density (BMD) is still the gold standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis, but bone turnover markers (BTMs) can provide helpful information regarding the bone remodeling process. The aim of this study was to determine the correlations between BMD and serum levels of BTMs (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-5b [TRAP-5b]), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), estradiol (E2), and magnesium (Mg[2+]) ion concentrations in postmenopausal osteoporotic women as compared to healthy postmenopausal subjects. Materials and methods The study included 132 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis and 81 healthy postmenopausal women without osteoporosis. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan assessed BMD at different skeleton sites. Serum levels of E2, BSAP, and TRAP-5b were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Serum levels of Mg(2+) were determined using the colorimetric spectrometry technique. Results Serum levels of BTMs were significantly higher in osteoporotic women than in controls. BSAP has a moderate sensitivity (76.5\%) and specificity (84.3\%) (cutoff point 21.27 U/L). At a cutoff point of 3.45 U/L, TRAP-5b presented a sensitivity of 86.3\% and a higher specificity of 90.6\%. Osteoporotic patients showed significantly lower concentrations of serum Mg(2+) than the control group. Mg(2+) levels correlated positively with BMD values (r=0.747, P{$<$}0.0001). Furthermore, Mg(2+) concentrations correlated positively with E2 levels (r=0.684, P{$<$}0.0001). Spine BMD correlated negatively with BSAP levels (r=-0.36, P{$<$}0.0001). Conclusion Our study showed that BMD correlates negatively with BTMs and positively with E2 and Mg(2+) levels. TRAP-5b presents a good specificity in identifying patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis.},

  abstract = {Calcium is the key macromineral having a role in skeletal structure and function, muscle contraction, and neurotransmission. Bone remodeling is maintained through a constant balance between calcium resorption and deposition. Calcium deficiency is resolved through calcium supplementation, and among the supplements, water-soluble organic molecules attracted great pharmaceutical interest. Calcium glucoheptonate is a highly water-soluble organic calcium salt having clinical use; however, detailed investigations on its biological effects are limited. We assessed the effects of calcium glucoheptonate on cell viability and proliferation of osteoblast-like MG-63 cells. Calcium uptake and mineralization were evaluated using Alizarin red staining of osteoblast-like MG-63 cells treated with calcium glucoheptonate. Expression of osteogenic markers were monitored by western blotting, immunofluorescence, and qRT-PCR assays. Increased proliferation and calcium uptake were observed in the MG-63 cells treated with calcium glucoheptonate. The treatment also increased the expression of osteopontin and osteogenic genes such as collagen-1, secreted protein acidic and cysteine rich (SPARC), and osteocalcin. Calcium glucoheptonate treatment did not exert any cytotoxicity on colorectal and renal epithelial cells, indicating the safety of the treatment. This is the first report with evidence for its beneficial effect for pharmaceutical use in addressing calcium deficiency conditions.},

Evidence suggesting the presence of direct and indirect associations between MetS and osteoporosis is growing. Many studies have reported the beneficial effects of polyphenols in alleviating MetS in in vivo and in vitro models through their antioxidant and anti-inflammation actions. This review aims to summarize the effects of honey (based on unifloral and multi-floral nectar sources) on bone metabolism and each component of MetS. A literature search was performed using the PubMed and Scopus databases using specific search strings. Original studies related to components of MetS and bone, and the effects of honey on components of MetS and bone were included. Honey polyphenols could act synergistically in alleviating MetS by preventing oxidative damage and inflammation. Honey intake is shown to reduce blood glucose levels and prevent excessive weight gain. It also improves lipid metabolism by reducing total cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein, as well as increasing high-density lipoprotein. Honey can prevent bone loss by reducing the adverse effects of MetS on bone homeostasis, apart from its direct action on the skeletal system. In conclusion, honey supplementation could be integrated into the management of MetS and MetS-induced bone loss as a preventive and adjunct therapeutic agent.},

Malabsorption can be caused by many diseases of the small intestine, as well as by diseases of the pancreas, liver, biliary tract, and stomach. This article provides an overview of pathophysiologic mechanisms that lead to symptoms or complications of maldigestion (defined as the defective intraluminal hydrolysis of nutrients) or malabsorption (defined as defective mucosal absorption), as well as its clinical consequences, including both gastrointestinal symptoms and extraintestinal manifestations and/or laboratory abnormalities. The normal uptake of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals by the gastrointestinal tract (GI) requires several steps, each of which can be compromised in disease. This article will first describe the mechanisms that lead to poor assimilation of nutrients, and secondly discuss the symptoms and nutritional consequences of each specific disorder. The clinician must be aware that many malabsorptive disorders are manifested by subtle disorders, even without gastrointestinal symptoms (for example, anemia, osteoporosis, or infertility in celiac disease), so the index of suspicion must be high to recognize the underlying diseases in time.},

Study Design A prospective, longitudinal study was conducted with two birth cohorts (1982 and 1993) in Pelotas, Southern Brazil. Measurements of bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) at 18 and 30 years of age were obtained by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Information on breastfeeding was collected during the first 4 years of life. Analyses were performed by linear regression and stratified by sex. Results A total of 1109 and 3226 participants provided complete information on breastfeeding in early life and bone mass at 18 and 30 years, respectively. No association between breastfeeding and bone mass was observed in women at both ages nor among men at age 30. Among men at the age of 18, BMC and BMD were higher among those breastfed regardless of duration (p=0.032 and p=0.043, respectively). Conclusions Despite a very weak positive effect of breastfeeding (yes/no) on BMC and BMD at age 18 in men, most findings pointed to a lack of association between breastfeeding and bone mass until young adulthood.},

Of the studies that assessed the outcome in childhood, two found a positive association and the others showed a negative effect of being breastfed on bone mass. In adolescence, three studies showed a positive association between being breastfed and bone outcomes. Among adults, a negative effect of being breastfed exclusively for a longer period of time on bone mass was observed only in men. In women, there was no effect of being breastfed on bone mass.

Dietary treatments were control non-copper, non-phytase group (0 Suppl); 4~mg~kg-1 Cu non-phytase group (25\%Cu); and 4~mg~kg-1 Cu~+~500 FTU~kg-1 phytase group (25\%Cu~+~phyt). The results show that birds fed with the addition of phytase exhibited improved weight gain and final body weight and had increased serum IGF-1 and osteocalcin concentrations. The serum concentration of Cu and P did not differ between groups; however, Ca concentration decreased in the 25\%Cu~+~phyt group when compared to the 25\%Cu group. Added Cu increased bone Ca, P, Cu, and ash content in Cu-supplemented groups, but bone weight and length increased only by the addition of phytase. Bone geometry, yield, and ultimate strengths were affected by Cu and phytase addition. A decrease of the elastic stress and ultimate stress of the tibia in Cu-supplemented groups was observed. The histomorphometric analysis showed a positive effect of Cu supplementation on real bone volume and trabecular thickness in the tibia metaphyseal trabeculae; additionally, phytase increased the trabeculea number. The supplementation with Cu significantly increased the total articular cartilage and growth plate cartilage thickness; however, the changes in thickness of particular zones were dependent upon phytase addition. In summary, dietary Cu supplements given to growing broilers with Cu in their diet restricted to 25\% of the daily requirement had a positive effect on bone metabolism, and phytase supplementation additionally improved cartilage development.},

Their focus was on the hepatic aspects of the disease. Recently, a position paper on pediatric WD was published by the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition. A need was felt to harmonize guidelines for the hepatic, pediatric, and neurological aspects of the disease and contextualize them to the resource-constrained settings. Therefore, experts from national societies from India representing 3 disciplines, hepatology (Indian National Association for Study of the Liver), pediatric hepatology (Indian Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition), and neurology (Movement Disorders Society of India) got together to evolve fresh guidelines. A literature search on retrospective and prospective studies of WD using MEDLINE (PubMed) was performed. Members voted on each recommendation, using the nominal voting technique. The Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation system was used to determine the quality of evidence. Questions related to diagnostic tests, scoring system, and its modification to a version suitable for resource-constrained settings were posed. While ceruloplasmin and 24-h urine copper continue to be important, there is little role of serum copper and penicillamine challenge test in the diagnostic algorithm. A new scoring system \textendash{} Modified Leipzig score has been suggested with extra points being added for family history and serum ceruloplasmin lower than 5~mg/dl. Liver dry copper estimation and penicillamine challenge test have been removed from the scoring system. Differences in pharmacological approach to neurological and hepatic disease and global monitoring scales have been included. Rising bilirubin and worsening encephalopathy are suggested as indicators predicting need for liver transplant but need to be validated. The clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations for a comprehensive management of WD which will be of value to all specialties.},

The older brother was admitted to our hospital for evaluation and treatment of recurrent abdominal pain, frequent diarrhea, and failure to thrive. Fecal calprotectin (FC) was elevated, and when combining this with his clinical presentation, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EoGE) was the first impression of his disease. Several ulcerative lesions were observed on ileocolonoscopy. However, incidental findings of suspicious bronchiectatic lesions were observed on plain radiography, which were confirmed by chest computed tomography. Moreover, diffuse bowel wall thickening with pancreatic atrophy was also incidentally detected by computed tomography of the abdomen. Comprehensively, these findings were highly suggestive of CF. Therefore, diagnostic exome sequencing was conducted, which revealed compound heterozygous variants of c.263T{$>$}G (p.Leu88*) and c.2977G{$>$}T (p.Asp993Tyr) in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene. Although symptoms in the younger brother were not as prominent as the older brother, genetic test was also conducted, which revealed the same mutation. We report the identification of a novel variant, p.Asp993Tyr, in siblings with Korean heritage. Although CF is rare in Koreans, it should be included in the differential diagnosis of IBD.},

Results: One hundred and seventeen elderly male subjects [60 men without symptoms of prostate hyperplasia, 42 men with untreated benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and 15 men with prostate cancer (PCa)] treated with finasteride or flutamide were included. Multiple comparisons showed significant difference in age, T-score, concentration of phosphorus, calcium, C-reactive protein, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) between the groups. T-score was the lowest and phosphorus concentration was the highest in the PCa group. Highest PSA, proteins, calcium, and Hekal's formula score were found in the BPH group. Patients with PCa were more frequent GG+GA carriers of 5-HT1B 1997A/G gene polymorphism (p=0.035). Univariate regression analysis showed association of PCa-treated subjects with age (p=0.010) and 5-HT1B genetic polymorphism (p=0.018). Antiandrogen therapy affects T-score (p=0.017), serum phosphorus (p=0.008), glucose (p=0.036), and total proteins (p=0.050). Multivariate-stepwise logistic regression analysis showed the significant association of treated PCa with age (p=0.028) and inorganic phosphorus (p=0.005), and a marginal association with ultrasonographic T-score (p=0.052). Conclusions: Antiandrogen therapy might induce bone mineral loss in elderly PCa patients. Preliminary data imply that the genetic variants of the 5-HT1B receptor might be associated with PCa.},

  abstract = {Rationale: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative multisystem disorder, presenting with limb or bulbar onset. To date, there is no cure for ALS. At some stage of the disease, patients may complain of breathlessness due to respiratory failure, thus needing a noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) support. However, breathlessness is a symptom that may be induced by different causes that must be taken into consideration in ALS management. Patients concerns: We report the case of an 81-year-old man, with a spinal onset ALS, who was admitted to our clinic to start NIMV because of respiratory involvement. After 3 weeks from NIMV performed at night time, with beneficial effects, he suddenly complained of breathlessness even at rest and in standing position. Diagnosis: Respiratory and cardiac assessments did not show new clinical events, indicating the worsening respiratory function. Due to a history of osteoporosis which was treated with biphosphonates and even though no previous bone trauma or falls were reported, we performed a spine computed tomography scan. The findings indicated multiple dorsal vertebral fractures which was a probable cause for breathlessness. Interventions and outcomes: Considering the neurodegenerative disease associated to respiratory failure, the cardiovascular risk factors and the age, the patient refused to undergo a surgery with kyphoplasty. A spine support was then prescribed, together with analgesic medications, with significant alleviation of pain and breathlessness. Lessons: The occurrence of breathlessness in a patient with ALS cannot always be related to the bulbar involvement. Other causes should be taken into account, especially when there is sudden worsening of symptoms in spite of good clinical response and compliance to NIMV treatment.},

  abstract = {The growth and development of the human skeleton requires an adequate supply of many different nutritional factors. Classical nutrient deficiencies are associated with stunting (e.g. energy, protein, Zn), rickets (e.g. vitamin D) and other bone abnormalities (e.g. Cu, Zn, vitamin C). In recent years there has been interest in the role nutrition may play in bone growth at intakes above those required to prevent classical deficiencies, particularly in relation to optimising peak bone mass and minimising osteoporosis risk. There is evidence to suggest that peak bone mass and later fracture risk are influenced by the pattern of growth in childhood and by nutritional exposures in utero, in infancy and during childhood and adolescence. Of the individual nutrients, particular attention has been paid to Ca, vitamin D, protein and P. There has also been interest in several food groups, particularly dairy products, fruit and vegetables and foods contributing to acid\textendash base balance. However, it is not possible at the present time to define dietary reference values using bone health as a criterion, and the question of what type of diet constitutes the best support for optimal bone growth and development remains open. Prudent recommendations (; World Health Organization/Food and Agriculture Organization, 2003) are the same as those for adults, i.e. to consume a Ca intake close to the reference nutrient intake, optimise vitamin D status through adequate summer sunshine exposure (and diet supplementation where appropriate), be physically active, have a body weight in the healthy range, restrict salt intake and consume plenty of fruit and vegetables.},

  abstract = {Background: Heavy metals, such as lead, cadmium, and mercury, are absorbed through contaminated food sources and water. Few studies have investigated the extent to which dietary heavy metals are associated with low bone mineral density. Aims: We aimed to characterize the dietary intake of the heavy metals lead, cadmium and mercury among healthy, non-smoking postmenopausal women in Spain. Furthermore, we sought to establish a putative relationship between bone health and the intake of these heavy metals in this population. Study Design: The daily intake of the heavy metals considered for the different food groups was calculated by accounting for food content and consumption in 281 postmenopausal women. Bone measurements were performed using a Quantitative Bone Ultrasound (QUS), a Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) and a Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (pQCT). Results: The average estimated dietary cadmium exposure among the 281 women studied was 29.87 {$\mu$}g/day (20.41\textendash 41.04) and 3.03 {$\mu$}g/kg body weight (b.w.; 2.17\textendash 4.40). Dietary lead exposure was 46.24 {$\mu$}g/day (38.11\textendash 54.77) and 4.87 {$\mu$}g/kg b.w. (4.00\textendash 6.14). The estimated dietary mercury exposure was 11.64 {$\mu$}g/day and 1.19 {$\mu$}g/kg b.w. (0.82\textendash 1.76). Participants were classified according to their heavy metal intake (above or below the respective medians). After further adjustment for potential confounding factors, no significant differences were found in all the measured parameters (p {$>$} 0.05). Conclusions: We did not find associations between bone health and the dietary intake of three heavy metals in postmenopausal women. Dietary intake of the measured heavy metals were within the recommended values.},

  abstract = {Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been practiced in the treatment of bone diseases and alcoholism. Chronic excessive alcohol use results in alcohol-induced bone diseases, including osteopenia and osteoporosis, which increases fracture risk, deficient bone repair, and osteonecrosis. This preclinical study investigated the therapeutic effects of TCM herbal extracts in animal models of chronic excessive alcohol consumption-induced osteopenia. TCM herbal extracts (Jing extracts) were prepared from nine Chinese herbal medicines, a combinative herbal formula for antifatigue and immune regulation, including Astragalus, Cistanche deserticola, Dioscorea polystachya, Lycium barbarum, Epimedium, Cinnamomum cassia, Syzygium aromaticum, Angelica sinensis, and Curculigo orchioides. In this study, Balb/c male mice were orally administrated alcohol (3.2~g/kg/day) with/without TCM herbal extracts (0.125~g/kg, 0.25~g/kg, or 0.5~g/kg) by gavage. Our results showed that after 50~days of oral administration, TCM herbal extracts prevented alcohol-induced osteopenia demonstrated by {$\mu$}-CT bone morphological analysis in young adults and middle-aged/old Balb/c male mice. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that chronic alcohol consumption inhibits bone formation and has a neutral impact on bone resorption, suggesting that TCM herbal extracts (Jing extracts) mitigate the alcohol-induced abnormal bone metabolism in middle-aged/old male mice. Protocatechuic acid, a natural phenolic acid in Jing extracts, mitigates in vivo alcohol-induced decline of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) gene expression in the bone marrow of Balb/c male mice and in vitro ALP activity in pre-osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells. Our study suggests that TCM herbal extracts prevent chronic excessive alcohol consumption-induced osteopenia in male mice, implying that traditional medicinal plants have the therapeutic potential of preventing alcohol-induced bone diseases.},

  abstract = {Osteoporosis is a disease of the skeletal system characterized by low bone mass and bone weakening, which increase the risk of fracture. This disease is associated with menopause because hypoestrogenism induces the maturation and activation of osteoclasts. In addition, a low dietary intake of calcium leads to low bone mineral density and postmenopausal osteoporosis. The objectives of this work were to determine calcium bioavailability of Opuntia ficus-indica cladodes at a late maturity stage and to assess its contribution in improving bone health in an ovariectomized rat model. Two-month-old Wistar female rats (n = 35) were used and distributed in seven experimental groups: (i) control group (Crtl), (ii) sham group (SH), (iii) ovariectomized group (OVX), (iv) ovariectomized group supplemented with calcium citrate (CCa), (v) ovariectomized group supplemented with O. ficus-indica powder (NI), (vi) ovariectomized group supplemented with soluble fiber from O. ficus-indica (FS) and (vii) ovariectomized group supplemented with insoluble fiber from O. ficus-indica (FI). Our results showed that calcium in the soluble fiber of O. ficus-indica is bioavailable and contributes to improve the physical, densitometric, biomechanical and microstructural properties of bones in ovariectomized rats. These findings indicated that O. ficus-indica cladodes at a late maturity stage represent a good source of bioavailable calcium and consumption of these cladodes might be beneficial for the prevention of osteoporosis and other bone diseases.},

Total body BMD, BMC, total and visceral fat, and appendicular skeletal mass (ASM) were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. ASM index, and total and visceral fat were positively correlated with BMD. Bone Zn correlated neither with sex hormones nor with bone turnover markers; however, it was positively associated both with BMD and with BMC, while bone Cu (as opposed to serum Cu) was not. In multiple regression, the ASM index, Zn/Cu ratio (in both the serum and the bone), and serum Cu concentration were significantly associated with BMD and BMC after adjustment for age and body mass index (BMI).

  abstract = {Summary The study evaluated if men and women with severe tooth wear were at increased risk of general bone loss. Enamel biopsies obtained from 50 subjects aged 47.5\,{$\pm$}\,5~years showed decreased copper content, which was associated with reduced spine bone mineral density, suggesting deficits of this trace element contributing to bone demineralization, enamel attrition, and deteriorated quality of mineralized tissues. Introduction The objective of this cross-sectional study was to assess associations between enamel trace minerals and bone mineral density (BMD) in severe tooth wear. We hypothesized that similar factors contributed to both the excessive abrasion of dental enamel and reduced BMD in subjects with tooth wear. Methods Fifty patients aged 47.5\,{$\pm$}\,5~years with severe tooth wear and 20 age-, sex-, and body mass index (BMI)-matched healthy volunteers with normal dental status were studied regarding dietary intakes of trace elements, serum and salivary copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and calcium (Ca) concentrations, and serum PTH, osteocalcin, and hydroxyvitamin D levels. Tooth wear was determined using clinical examination based on standard protocol according to Smith and Knight. In all subjects, acid biopsies of the maxillary central incisors were carried out to assess mineral composition of the enamel. Atomic absorption spectroscopy with an air/acetylene flame was used to measure Ca and Zn, and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy was used to analyze Cu content. BMD was examined using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results Tooth wear patients had reduced lumbar spine, but not femoral, BMD relative to controls (p\,{$<$}\,0.001). No differences were found in enamel Ca concentration and Zn content was slightly higher in tooth wear patients than in controls whereas Cu content was significantly decreased in the patients: 19.59\,{$\pm$}\,16.4 vs 36.86\,{$\pm$}\,26.1~{$\mu$}g/l (p\,=\,0.01) despite similar levels of Cu in serum and saliva. The differences were independent of serum 25-OH-D, osteocalcin concentrations or PTH either. Conclusion Severe tooth wear is associated with reduced spinal BMD.

  abstract = {Magnesium is an essential nutrient for muscle, cardiovascular, and bone health on Earth, and during space flight. We sought to evaluate magnesium status in 43 astronauts (34 male, 9 female; 47 {$\pm$} 5 years old, mean {$\pm$} SD) before, during, and after 4\textendash 6-month space missions. We also studied individuals participating in a ground analog of space flight (head-down-tilt bed rest; n = 27 (17 male, 10 female), 35 {$\pm$} 7 years old). We evaluated serum concentration and 24-h urinary excretion of magnesium, along with estimates of tissue magnesium status from sublingual cells. Serum magnesium increased late in flight, while urinary magnesium excretion was higher over the course of 180-day space missions. Urinary magnesium increased during flight but decreased significantly at landing. Neither serum nor urinary magnesium changed during bed rest. For flight and bed rest, significant correlations existed between the area under the curve of serum and urinary magnesium and the change in total body bone mineral content. Tissue magnesium concentration was unchanged after flight and bed rest. Increased excretion of magnesium is likely partially from bone and partially from diet, but importantly, it does not come at the expense of muscle tissue stores. While further study is needed to better understand the implications of these findings for longer space exploration missions, magnesium homeostasis and tissue status seem well maintained during 4\textendash 6-month space missions.},

  abstract = {Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate the relations between bone mineral density (BMD) and lead in blood, tibia, and patella and to investigate how BMD modifies these lead biomarkers in older women. Design In this study, we used cross-sectional analysis. Participants We studied 112 women, 50\textendash 70 years of age, including both whites and African Americans, residing in Baltimore, Maryland. Measurements We measured lumbar spine BMD, blood and bone lead by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, anodic stripping voltammetry, and 109Cd-induced K-shell X-ray fluorescence, respectively. We measured vitamin D receptor and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes using standard methods. Results Mean ({$\pm$} SD) BMD and lead levels in blood, tibia, and patella were 1.02 {$\pm$} 0.16 g/cm2, 3.3 {$\pm$} 2.2 {$\mu$}g/dL, 19.7 {$\pm$} 13.2 {$\mu$}g/g, and 5.7 {$\pm$} 15.3 {$\mu$}g/g, respectively. In adjusted analysis, higher BMD was associated with higher tibia lead levels (p = 0.03). BMD was not associated with lead levels in blood or patella. There was evidence of significant effect modification by BMD on relations of physical activity with blood lead levels and by APOE genotype on relations of BMD with tibia lead levels. There was no evidence that BMD modified relations between tibia lead or patella lead and blood lead levels. Conclusions We believe that BMD represents the capacity of bone that can store lead, by substitution for calcium, and thus the findings may have relevance for effect-size estimates in persons with higher BMD. Relevance to clinical practice The results have implications for changes in lead kinetics with aging, and thus the related risk of health effects associated with substantial early- and midlife lead exposure in older persons.},

Kefir is a product made by kefir grains that degrade milk proteins into various peptides with health-promoting effects, including antithrombotic, antimicrobial and calcium-absorption enhancing bioactivities. In a controlled, parallel, double-blind intervention study over 6 months, we investigated the effects of kefir-fermented milk (1,600 mg) supplemented with calcium bicarbonate (CaCO3, 1,500 mg) and bone metabolism in 40 osteoporosis patients, and compared them with CaCO3 alone without kefir supplements. Bone turnover markers were measured in fasting blood samples collected before therapy and at 1, 3, and 6 months. Bone mineral density (BMD) values at the spine, total hip, and hip femoral neck were assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and at 6 months. Among patients treated with kefir-fermented milk, the relationships between baseline turnover and 6 months changes in DXA-determined BMD were significantly improved. The serum {$\beta$} C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen ({$\beta$}-CTX) in those with T-scores {$>$} -1 patients significantly decreased after three months treatment. The formation marker serum osteocalcin (OC) turned from negative to positive after 6 months, representing the effect of kefir treatment. Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) increased significantly after treatment with kefir, but decreased significantly in the control group. PTH may promote bone remodeling after treatment with kefir for 6 months. In this pilot study, we concluded that kefir-fermented milk therapy was associated with short-term changes in turnover and greater 6-month increases in hip BMD among osteoporotic patients.,  Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02361372},

  abstract = {Background In coming decades the proportion of very elderly people living in the Western world will dramatically increase. This forthcoming "grey epidemic" will lead to an explosion of chronic diseases. In order to anticipate booming health care expenditures and to assure that social security is funded in the future, research focusing on the relationship between chronic diseases, frailty and disability is needed. The general aim of the BELFRAIL cohort study (BFC80+) is to study the dynamic interaction between health, frailty and disability in a multi-system approach focusing on cardiac dysfunction and chronic heart failure, lung function, sarcopenia, renal insufficiency and immunosenescence. Methods/Design The BFC80+ is a prospective, observational, population-based cohort study of subjects aged 80 years and older in three well-circumscribed areas of Belgium. In total, 29 general practitioner (GP) centres were asked to include patients aged 80 and older. Only three exclusion criteria were used: severe dementia, in palliative care and medical emergency. Two sampling methods for the recruitment of patients were used. Between November 2, 2008 and September 15, 2009, 567 subjects were included in the BFC80+ study. Every study participant was invited to undergo four study visits. The GP recorded background variables and medical history and performed a detailed anamnesis and clinical examination. The clinical research assistant performed an extensive examination including performance testing, questionnaires and technical examinations. Echocardiography was performed at home by a cardiologist. A blood sample was collected in the morning. Follow-up reporting of hard outcome measures including mortality, hospitalization and morbidity was organized. A second data collection is planned after 18 months. Discussion The BFC80+ was designed to acquire a better understanding of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of chronic diseases in the very elderly and to study the dynamic interaction between health, frailty and disability in a multi-system approach. The wide variety of dimensions investigated in the BFC80+ will enable us not only to investigate in depth the relationship between the different physiological systems but also to initiate new research questions based on this unique database of community-dwelling elderly.},

  abstract = {One risk factor for osteoporosis that has attracted increasing attention in recent years is exposure to cadmium. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between low-level cadmium exposure, from diet and smoking, and bone mineral density (BMD) and incident fractures in elderly men. The study population consisted of 936 men from the Swedish cohort of the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study, aged 70 to 81 years at inclusion (years 2002 to 2004), with reliable data on cadmium in urine (U-Cd) analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry in baseline samples. The participants also answered a questionnaire on lifestyle factors and medical history. BMD was measured at baseline using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in the total body, hip, and lumbar spine. During the follow-up period (until 2013), all new fractures were registered by date and type. Associations between BMD and U-Cd were assessed using multiple linear regression, and associations between incident fractures and baseline U-Cd were analyzed using Cox regression. In both cases, a number of potential confounders and other risk factors (eg, age, smoking, body mass index [BMI], and physical activity) were included in the models. We found significant negative associations between U-Cd and BMD, with lower BMD (4\% to 8\%) for all sites in the fourth quartile of U-Cd, using the first quartile as the reference. In addition, we found positive associations between U-Cd and incident fractures, especially nonvertebral osteoporosis fractures in the fourth quartile of U-Cd, with hazard ratios of 1.8 to 3.3 in the various models. U-Cd as a continuous variable was significantly associated with nonvertebral osteoporosis fractures (adjusted hazard ratio 1.3 to 1.4 per {$\mu$}g Cd/g creatinine), also in never-smokers, but not with the other fracture groups (all fractures, hip fractures, vertebral fractures, and other fractures). Our results indicate that even relatively low cadmium exposure through diet and smoking increases the risk of low BMD and osteoporosis-related fractures in elderly men. \textcopyright{} 2015 The Authors.

Methods Data for analyses were collected from a population based cross-sectional study performed at the Xiangya Hospital Health Management Centre. Dietary Se intake was evaluated using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. OP was diagnosed on the basis of bone mineral density scans using a compact radiographic absorptiometry system. The correlation between dietary Se intake and the prevalence of OP was primarily examined by multivariable logistic regression. Results This cross-sectional study included a total of 6267 subjects (mean age: 52.2\,{$\pm$}\,7.4\,years; 42\% women), and the prevalence of OP among the included subjects was 9.6\% (2.3\% in men and 19.7\% in women). Compared with the lowest quartile, the energy intake, age, gender and body mass index (BMI)-adjusted odds ratios of OP were 0.72 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.55\textendash 0.94), 0.72 (95\% CI 0.51\textendash 1.01) and 0.47 (95\% CI 0.31\textendash 0.73) for the second, third and fourth quartiles of dietary Se intake, respectively (P for trend\,=\,0.001). The results remained consistent in male and female subjects. Adjustment for additional potential confounders (i.e., smoking status, drinking status, physical activity level, nutritional supplements, diabetes, hypertension, fibre intake, and calcium intake) did not cause substantial changes to the results. Conclusions In the middle-aged and older humans, participants with lower levels of dietary Se intake have a higher prevalence of OP in a dose-response manner.},

Obesity was previously thought to be bone protective, but this is indeed not the case. Morbidly obese individuals are at risk for metabolic bone disease (MBD) due to chronic vitamin D deficiency, inadequate calcium intake, sedentary lifestyle, chronic dieting, underlying chronic diseases, and the use of certain medications used to treat those diseases. After bariatric surgery, the risk for bone-related problems is even greater, owing to severely restricted intake, malabsorption, poor compliance with prescribed supplements, and dramatic weight loss. Patients presenting for bariatric surgery should be evaluated for MBD and receive appropriate presurgical interventions. Furthermore, every patient who has undergone bariatric surgery should receive meticulous lifetime monitoring, as the risk for developing MBD remains ever present.},

This study aims to establish different ketogenic rat models and compare the influence of EODKD with KD on bone microstructure and metabolism. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into Control, KD and EODKD groups, fed with standard diet, continuous and intermittent ketogenic diet respectively. After 12 weeks, bone mineral density (BMD) and body fat percentage were obtained by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Micro-CT and three-point bending test were used to evaluate the bone microstructure and mechanical properties. Activities of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) were measured, together with the osteogenic capabilities of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) tested by ALP activities and alizarin red stain in different osteogenic stage. Both EODKD and KD induced higher ketone and more fat percentage, but led to lower body weight compared with Control group. They both compromised bone mass and mechanical properties. Compared with KD, EODKD demonstrated higher ketone levels, but it also inhibited osteoclastic process as well as early osteogenic differentiation. In general, EODKD accelerated ketosis, but may not deteriorate bone microstructure and strength than KD.},

Several minerals appear to be important determinants of insulin-like growth factor (IGF), the bioactivity of which regulates bone and mineral metabolism.

This study aims to evaluate the relationships between essential elements and IGF levels among postmenopausal Saudi women with osteoporosis. A total of 128 postmenopausal Saudi women aged {$\geq$}50 years old were recruited in this study. Diagnosis of osteoporosis was done by using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry to determine the bone minerals density (BMD). Serum calcium and phosphate were determined using routine chemical analyzer. Serum Co, Mn, Ni, Cd were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Serum IGF-1 and IGF-2 were determined using Luminex xMAP. Using stepwise linear regression analysis, only Cd was identified to be significantly associated with IGF1 in osteoporosis, explaining 3\% (confidence interval 0.01\textendash 0.05; P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0001) of the variance perceived. Our results suggest that Cd exposure indirectly affects BMD which may increase the risk of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Further longitudinal study using a larger sample size is recommended to determine causality of Cd levels and IGF-1.},

Guidelines for the management of this condition are still lacking, and making the diagnosis requires fulfillment of strict criteria. Recent studies have shown that intermittent oscillations of serum calcium just below and slightly above the normal limits are very frequent, therefore challenging the assumption that serum calcium must be consistently normal to make the diagnosis. There is debate if these variations in serum calcium outside the normal range should be included under the rubric of NHPT or, rather, a milder form of classical primary hyperparathyroidism. Innovative approaches to define NHPT have been proposed that still need to be validated in prospective studies. Non-classical complications, especially cardiovascular complications, have been associated with NHPT, indicating that hyperparathyroidism may be a cardiovascular risk factor. New associations between parathyroid hormone (PTH) and several other comorbidities have also been reported from observational studies, suggesting that excessive PTH secretion might cause tissue dysfunction independent of serum calcium. Heterogeneous studies using different definitions of NHPT, however, make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions regarding the role of PTH excess when complications other than osteoporosis or kidney stones are described. This review will focus on clinical aspects and suggest an approach to NHPT.},

The association between serum cholesterol and BMD remains controversial. Thus, the correlation between serum lipids and BMD in women was explored in the current study. Materials and Methods This cross-sectional study included 1116 Chinese female participants. Serum samples were collected to evaluate total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and other laboratory markers. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to assess lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip BMD. Results In the postmenopausal women, a non-linear relationship was detected between TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and lumbar spine BMD. Using segmented linear regression, the inflection points were 5.86 mmol/L, 3.52 mmol/L, and 2.37 mmol/L, respectively. To the left of the inflection point, the higher the serum lipid level, the lower the value for lumbar spine BMD. To the right of the inflection point, the higher the serum level of TC and LDL-C, the higher the value for lumbar spine BMD. In the premenopausal women, the association between HDL-C and femoral neck BMD was non-linear. In addition, LDL-C had a positive association with BMD of the femoral neck and HDL-C had an inverse association with BMD of the femoral neck in postmenopausal women. Conclusion In postmenopausal women, the relationship between TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and lumbar spine BMD was non-linear. TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C were negatively associated with lumbar spine BMD when the values were less than 5.86 mmol/L, 3.52 mmol/L, and 2.37 mmol/L, respectively. The mechanisms of the association were unclear, and further research is warranted to clarify the relationship.},

  abstract = {Background Osteoporosis (OP) is a systemic bone disease characterized by decreased bone mass, destruction of the bone tissue microstructure, increased bone brittleness and an increased risk of fracture. OP has a high incidence rate and long disease course and is associated with serious complications. Yigu decoction (YGD) is a compound prescription in traditional Chinese medicine that is used to treat OP. However, its mechanism in OP is not clear. This study used a tandem mass tag (TMT)quantitative proteomics method to explore the potential bone-protective mechanism of YGD in an osteoporotic rat model. Materials and methods A rat model of OP was established by ovariectomy. Eighteen 12-week-old specific-pathogen-free female Wistar rats weighing 220\,{$\pm$}\,10~g were selected. The eighteen rats were randomly divided into 3 groups (n\,=\,6 in each group): the normal, model and YGD groups. The right femurs from each group were subjected to quantitative biological analysis. TMT quantitative proteomics was used to analyze the proteins extracted from the bone tissue of rats in the model and YGD groups, and the differentially expressed proteins after intervention with YGD were identified as biologically relevant proteins of interest. Functional annotation correlation analysis was also performed to explore the biological function and mechanism of YGD. Result Compared with the model group, the YGD group showed significant upregulation of 26 proteins (FC\,{$>$}\,1.2, P\,{$<$}\,0.05) and significant downregulation of 39 proteins (FC\,{$<$}\,0.833, P\,{$<$}\,0.05). Four important targets involved in OP and 5 important signaling pathways involved in bone metabolism were identified. Conclusions YGD can significantly increase the bone mineral density (BMD) of osteoporotic rats and may play a therapeutic role by regulating target proteins involved in multiple signaling pathways. Therefore, these results improve the understanding of the OP mechanism and provide an experimental basis for the clinical application of YGD in OP treatment.
